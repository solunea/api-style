  "description": "Ce style présente une abstraction géométrique minimaliste inspirée du mouvement Bauhaus et du constructivisme, utilisant des formes primitives pour déconstruire les sujets. Il repose sur des blocs plats et solides de couleurs vives et des bords nets sur un fond crème texturé, totalement dépourvu de dégradés ou d'ombres.",
  "description_en": "This style features a minimalist, geometric abstraction inspired by the Bauhaus movement and Constructivism, utilizing primitive shapes to deconstruct subjects. It relies on flat, solid blocks of bold color and sharp edges on a textured cream background, completely devoid of gradients or shading.",

  "prompt": "A highly stylized, minimalist geometric abstraction of {{subject}}, rendered in the distinct visual language of the Bauhaus movement and Russian Constructivism. The subject is deconstructed and reassembled using only fundamental geometric primitives—perfect circles, sharp triangles, squares, and rigid rectangles. The artistic technique mimics a high-end vector illustration or a clean screen print collage. The composition is strictly 2D flat design; there is absolutely no shading, no gradients, no drop shadows, and no depth of field. The forms are defined by razor-sharp hard edges and solid color fills. The color palette is bold and graphic, utilizing large blocks of {{primary_color}} as the dominant force, balanced by striking geometric accents of {{accent_color}}, anchored by heavy solid black structural elements and pure white negative space. The layout follows Swiss Design principles with asymmetrical balance and grid-like precision. The entire composition is set against a warm, subtle off-white or cream-colored matte paper texture to provide a vintage print feel. The mood is intellectual, modern, and structurally disciplined, focusing on shape interaction and color theory rather than realistic detail. minimalist, vector art, graphic design, Paul Rand style, Piet Mondrian influence, sharp focus, 4k, ultra-clean, architectural, abstract modernism, hard-edge painting.",
  "background_prompt": "A minimalist abstract background composition inspired by Constructivism, featuring a warm cream-colored paper texture. The scene is populated by sparse, floating geometric primitives—isolated triangles, lines, and circles—rendered in flat {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. These elements act as a framing device or a subtle backdrop, arranged asymmetrically with hard edges and no gradients. The style is strictly 2D flat design, creating a clean, architectural atmosphere without any central subject.",

  "prompt_removebg": "A striking geometric abstraction of {{subject}}, rendered in a classic Bauhaus and Constructivist graphic design style. The subject is deconstructed into fundamental geometric primitives: sharp triangles, perfect circles, semi-circles, and bold rectangles that assemble to suggest the form without realistic detail. The artwork utilizes a strict flat vector aesthetic with absolutely no gradients, no shading, no drop shadows, and no 3D depth. The color palette is high-contrast, featuring large solid blocks of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} balanced by heavy black structural elements and negative space. The edges are razor-sharp and mathematically precise. The finish mimics a high-quality vintage screen print or lithograph, possessing a subtle matte graininess and slight ink-bleed texture on a porous surface. The composition relies on asymmetry and dynamic balance typical of 1920s avant-garde posters. The entire illustration is isolated against a uniform {{background_color}} background, which serves as the paper or canvas substrate, ensuring distinct separation of the geometric forms.
