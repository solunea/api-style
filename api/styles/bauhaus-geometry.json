  "description": "Une abstraction géométrique rigoureuse enracinée dans les mouvements Bauhaus et De Stijl, réduisant les formes complexes à des primitives fondamentales comme des cercles, des triangles et des rectangles. Le style utilise une palette néoplasticiste stricte de couleurs primaires sur un fond blanc cassé plat, privilégiant l'équilibre structurel et la précision vectorielle sur la représentation réaliste.",
  "description_en": "A rigorous geometric abstraction rooted in the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements, reducing complex forms to fundamental primitives like circles, triangles, and rectangles. The style utilizes a strict Neoplasticist palette of primary colors against a flat, off-white background, emphasizing structural balance and vector precision over realistic representation.",

  "prompt": "A masterwork of Bauhaus and De Stijl inspired geometric abstraction featuring {{subject}}, rendered as a pure flat vector illustration. The composition deconstructs the subject into fundamental geometric primitives—perfect circles, sharp isosceles triangles, and rigid rectangles—assembled with architectural precision to suggest form without organic detail. The rendering technique is strictly flat design with zero shading, zero gradients, and zero depth of field, mimicking the aesthetic of a mid-century screen print or a Paul Rand graphic. The color palette is rigorously limited to a Neoplasticism scheme: dominant blocks of {{primary_color}} define the main mass, intersected by striking geometric accents of {{accent_color}} and bold matte black structural elements. The linework is minimal but purposeful, using thick, uniform black strokes only where necessary to define structural weight, while other forms rely on pure color contrast for separation. The lighting is non-existent; this is a conceptual space where light and shadow are replaced by the absolute clarity of shape and hue. The surface texture possesses a very subtle, high-quality matte paper grain, giving the digital vector a tactile, printed feel. The atmosphere is intellectual, organized, and clinically modern. The composition is balanced yet asymmetrical, utilizing the golden ratio to place geometric elements. The image fills the entire frame with a full bleed, ensuring the geometric interplay extends to the very edges of the canvas. {{mood}} energy is conveyed through the tension and angle of the geometric arrangements.

  "background_prompt": "A purely abstract geometric environment inspired by the architectural principles of the Bauhaus and the grid systems of De Stijl. The scene is composed of floating, intersecting planes and rigid rectangular subdivisions. Large fields of {{primary_color}} are balanced by smaller, precise accents of {{accent_color}} and thick, uniform black lines that traverse the composition horizontally and vertically. The background base is a warm, creamy off-white, textured slightly like heavy matte cardstock or archival paper. There is no depth, no perspective, and no shading; the space is defined entirely by the arrangement of 2D shapes and the rhythm of negative space. The layout feels mathematical and constructed, evoking the feeling of a modernist blueprint or an abstract map. The visual language is one of order, clarity, and industrial harmony.",
