  "description": "Ce style reproduit l'esthétique audacieuse et très contrastée de la linogravure traditionnelle ou de la gravure sur bois, caractérisée par des silhouettes lourdement encrées et des détails en espace négatif. Il présente des bords organiques légèrement rugueux et une palette de couleurs bicolore et plate qui imite l'aspect d'une impression en relief tamponnée ou sculptée à la main.",
  "description_en": "This style replicates the bold, high-contrast aesthetic of traditional linocut or woodblock printing, characterized by heavy inked silhouettes and negative space details. It features organic, slightly rough edges and a flat, two-tone color scheme that mimics the look of a hand-stamped or carved relief print.",

  "prompt": "A striking, high-contrast linocut print illustration of {{subject}}. The artwork must mimic the authentic aesthetic of a hand-carved woodblock, rubber stamp, or lino print. The subject is rendered as a bold, solid silhouette in deep {{primary_color}} ink, possessing a heavy visual weight and distinct, chunky geometry. Internal details, textures, and facial features are defined exclusively by 'carved out' negative space, revealing the flat {{accent_color}} background underneath, creating a stark two-tone effect. The lines should be thick, organic, and fluid, drawing inspiration from tribal art, Polynesian motifs, and primitive folk aesthetics. The edges of the forms should appear slightly imperfect and rough, simulating the physical pressure of ink on paper and the manual carving process. There are absolutely no gradients, shading, or 3D rendering; the image is entirely flat, graphic, and vector-like. The composition focuses on strong shapes and solid masses rather than intricate fine lines. The overall mood is rustic, handcrafted, and iconic, capturing the essence of relief printing techniques. The texture of the 'ink' should look solid but with microscopic jaggedness at the boundaries to enhance the stamped feel. --no shading, gradients, photorealism, 3D, blur, bokeh, perspective --v 6.0 --style raw",
  "prompt_removebg": "A striking, high-contrast linocut block print illustration of a {{subject}}. The artistic style mimics traditional Polynesian or tribal petroglyphs modernized into a bold graphic stamp. The subject is rendered in solid, heavy masses of {{primary_color}} ink, possessing a visual weight that suggests a hand-pressed relief print. Internal details and textures are created exclusively through negative space 'gouges' and scratch marks that reveal the underlying surface color, using {{accent_color}} for subtle carved highlights. The edges of the forms are slightly rough and organic, simulating the imperfections of a hand-carved lino sheet or woodblock. There is absolutely no shading, gradients, or 3D depth; the image is a purely flat, two-tone graphic composition. The lines are thick, curvilinear, and stylized, emphasizing silhouette over realistic proportion. The artwork is set against a clean, flat {{background_color}} background, ensuring a stark separation between the inked subject and the surface. The overall aesthetic is rustic, artisanal, and iconic, capturing the essence of folk art and primitive symbolism.",
  "background_prompt": "A flat, textured surface resembling matte construction paper, heavy cardstock, or fabric in a solid {{accent_color}} hue. The background acts as a blank canvas for a relief print, potentially featuring subtle, repetitive tribal patterns or woodgrain textures that are barely visible, rendered in a slightly lighter or darker shade of {{accent_color}} to maintain a monochromatic and minimalist look. The texture should suggest a fibrous material capable of absorbing {{primary_color}} ink, with no depth of field or lighting effects, remaining completely 2D and graphic.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A textured background surface featuring repetitive tribal geometric patterns, stylized wave motifs, and rough-hewn borders carved in a linocut style. The design uses bold {{primary_color}} block shapes and {{accent_color}} gouge marks against a {{background_color}} surface, creating a decorative frame or wallpaper effect that mimics a hand-stamped fabric or woodblock print texture without any central subject.",
