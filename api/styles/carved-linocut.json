  "description": "Un style graphique audacieux fusionnant l'esthétique des pétroglyphes polynésiens avec les qualités tactiles et brutes de la linogravure ou de la xylographie sculptée à la main. Il présente des silhouettes lourdes et très contrastées où les détails internes sont définis par un espace négatif sculpté, une stylisation géométrique angulaire et des textures d'encre 'tamponnées'.",
  "description_en": "A bold graphic style fusing Polynesian petroglyph aesthetics with the rough, tactile qualities of hand-carved linocut or woodblock printing. It features heavy, high-contrast silhouettes where internal details are defined by carved negative space, angular geometric stylization, and 'stamped' ink textures.",

  "prompt": "A high-contrast, monochromatic linocut print illustration featuring {{subject}} rendered in a bold, primitive tribal style reminiscent of Rapanui petroglyphs and Polynesian tattoo art. The visual language relies exclusively on heavy, solid masses of {{primary_color}} ink pressed onto a textured substrate. The {{subject}} is stylized into a totemic emblem, utilizing thick, angular curves, meander-like geometric patterns, and simplified blocky forms to suggest anatomical structure and movement. There are absolutely no gradients, shadows, or 3D modeling; the image is a purely flat 2D graphic design. Internal details—such as texture, facial features, or patterns on the {{subject}}—are depicted as 'carved out' voids and scratchy gouge marks, revealing the underlying {{accent_color}} background through the dense ink. The edges of the silhouette are intentionally imperfect and organic, exhibiting the rough, slight bleed of a hand-stamped block print or woodcut, with microscopic irregularities where the carving tool would have slipped or the ink did not fully transfer. The surface texture within the solid {{primary_color}} areas includes subtle noise, grain, and speckling to mimic the uneven application of viscous printing ink on porous paper. The composition is iconic and centered, filling the frame with the {{subject}} as a singular graphic entity. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, conveyed through the stark, ancient symbolism and the raw materiality of the print process. The lighting is abstract and conceptual, defined only by the binary contrast between the dark ink and the light background. The background is a solid, flat field of {{accent_color}}, providing maximum contrast to the bold {{primary_color}} linework. No frame, no border, full bleed composition.",

  "background_prompt": "A textured, flat graphic surface mimicking the quality of coarse recycled paper or a matte fabric weave, rendered in a solid shade of {{accent_color}}. The texture is subtle, visible only as microscopic grain and fiber irregularities that suggest a tactile, analog print medium. Faint, distressed markings or 'noise' consistent with a worn printing block surface are scattered sparsely across the field, but the overall appearance is of a clean, minimalist backdrop designed to support a high-contrast foreground. Lighting is uniform and flat, creating no shadows or gradients, maintaining a purely 2D illustrative aesthetic.",
