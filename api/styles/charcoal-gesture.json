  "description": "Un style d'illustration de mode brut et gestuel imitant les esquisses rapides au fusain ou au graphite tendre sur papier texturé. Caractérisé par des hachures verticales agressives, des lignes lâches et confiantes, et un contraste élevé privilégiant la silhouette et l'attitude plutôt que la précision anatomique.",
  "description_en": "A raw, gestural fashion illustration style mimicking rapid charcoal or soft graphite sketches on textured paper. Characterized by aggressive vertical hatching, confident loose lines, and a high-contrast focus on silhouette and attitude over anatomical precision.",

  "prompt": "Traditional analog media simulation, raw compressed charcoal and soft 6B graphite on rough-tooth archival cream paper. The {{subject}} is rendered in a rapid, gestural fashion illustration style (croquis), characterized by confident, aggressive vertical hatching strokes that define volume without enclosing outlines. The rendering creates a sense of immediacy and movement, with the {{subject}}'s form emerging from heavy, scribbled darks and untouched negative space. The stroke behavior is frenetic yet controlled, utilizing broad side-shading for mass and sharp, piercing lines for details. The palette is primarily monochromatic deep charcoal and graphite gray, with {{primary_color}} applied as a subtle, dry-pastel accent tinting the shadows, and {{accent_color}} appearing as sparse, distinct sketch marks to draw the eye. Lighting is not photorealistic but illustrative, defined by the contrast between the dense accumulation of graphite (shadow) and the raw paper grain (light). Texture is paramount: visible paper tooth, friable charcoal debris, skipped strokes where the medium glides over paper valleys, and slight smudging suggesting a hand-rubbed finish. The composition is centered and floating, capturing the {{mood}} through the energy of the line work rather than facial expression. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, focused entirely on the expressive capture of the {{subject}}.",

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist environmental study rendered in faint, sweeping charcoal lines and soft graphite smudges. The scene suggests a vague, atmospheric setting without specific detail, utilizing loose perspective lines and broad, low-opacity strokes to imply depth and space. The texture mimics rough-tooth paper with skipped strokes and granular noise. The tonal range is very high-key, mostly negative space with hints of {{primary_color}} in the deepest shadows and {{accent_color}} as a singular, abstract mark or directional line. The atmosphere is quiet, unfinished, and artistic.",
