  "description": "Un style d'esquisse brut et expressif qui imite le fusain rapide ou le graphite tendre sur du papier à gros grain. Il se caractérise par des hachures verticales énergiques, des lignes tourbillonnantes lâches et une absence de contours continus, définissant la forme par la densité des traits et le contraste marqué entre le médium sec et le substrat texturé.",
  "description_en": "A raw, expressive sketching style that mimics rapid charcoal or soft graphite on coarse-grain paper. It is characterized by energetic vertical hatching, loose swirling lines, and a lack of continuous contours, defining form through stroke density and the stark contrast between the dry medium and the textured substrate.",

  "prompt": "A raw, expressive charcoal sketch executing a rapid gestural study of {{subject}}. The image must occupy the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space with no borders, frames, or white margins, featuring a full-bleed composition where the texture of the paper extends to every corner. The rendering technique utilizes dry, heavy charcoal or soft graphite applied with frantic energy onto coarse-grain drawing paper. The {{subject}} is deconstructed into a series of aggressive, vertical hatching strokes and loose, swirling lines that suggest form without defining rigid outlines. There is a distinct lack of closed shapes; instead, the essence of the {{subject}} is captured through the varying density of the marks, ranging from opaque, heavy blocks of {{primary_color}} to lighter, scratchy indications. The texture is palpable, with the dry medium skipping over the tooth of the paper, creating a gritty, stippled effect within the dark areas. The lighting is conceptual, defined purely by the contrast between the dense charcoal application and the negative space of the paper. The color palette is strictly monochromatic and high-contrast, dominated by {{primary_color}} strokes against a {{secondary_color}} paper background, with {{accent_color}} appearing only as faint, incidental smudges or a stylized artist's signature line. The atmosphere is immediate and fleeting, evoking the feeling of a quick life-drawing session or a fashion croquis where movement and emotion take precedence over anatomical precision. The edges of the {{subject}} are rough and open, fading into the surrounding negative space with trailing lines and erratic marks.",

  "background_prompt": "A macro close-up view of empty, coarse-grain drawing paper texture filling the entire field of view. The surface is uneven and fibrous, dominated by the tone of {{secondary_color}}. The lighting is flat and even, emphasizing the tooth of the paper. Sparse, accidental artifacts of the artistic process are visible: faint, scattered dust particles of {{primary_color}} charcoal, a few erratic, almost invisible scratch marks in {{accent_color}}, and the slight unevenness of the paper pulp. There is no central subject, only the raw, tactile potential of the blank page waiting for a sketch, with a gritty, analog atmosphere.",

In the immediate foreground, a rough, hand-drawn rectangular border rendered in heavy, messy {{primary_color}} charcoal strokes frames the empty space, creating a window for the invisible subject. This textured paper scene and its charcoal frame are rendered against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop, with the torn and rough edges of the paper texture transitioning sharply onto the solid color surface.",
