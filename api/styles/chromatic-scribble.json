  "description": "Un style d'illustration numérique vibrant imitant les techniques sèches comme le crayon de couleur et le pastel, caractérisé par des hachures croisées énergiques et des choix de couleurs non naturalistes. La technique utilise une approche 'fauviste' où la forme et l'ombre sont définies par des changements de teinte—comme des bleus canard et des roses pour les tons chair—plutôt que par des valeurs traditionnelles, créant une surface texturée et vivante.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant digital illustration style mimicking dry media like colored pencil and chalk pastel, characterized by loose, energetic cross-hatching and non-naturalistic color choices. The technique uses a 'Fauvist' approach where form and shadow are defined by hue shifts—such as teals and pinks for skin tones—rather than traditional value grading, creating a lively, textured surface.",

  "prompt": "Digital dry-media illustration simulating colored pencil and rough chalk pastel on toothy paper, featuring {{subject}} captured in a vibrant, expressive sketchy style. The rendering technique relies on visible, unblended strokes and energetic cross-hatching to build form and volume without smooth gradients. The subject's surface texture is constructed through a mosaic of separated marks, utilizing a Fauvist color logic where local colors are replaced by expressive hues: shadows are rendered in deep cool tones like {{primary_color}} and electric teals, while highlights are sculpted with warm {{accent_color}}, peach, and pale yellow scribbles. Line work is loose and variable, with outlines appearing as concentrated clusters of sketch marks rather than solid ink lines. The lighting {{lighting}} is soft and diffuse, translated into color temperature shifts rather than heavy contrast, avoiding pure black entirely in favor of saturated darks. The hair or outer textures are depicted with frantic, squiggly loops and gestural lines that imply movement. The composition is centered and intimate, with the subject filling the frame, creating a raw, hand-drawn aesthetic that feels both unfinished and deliberate. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, conveyed through the interplay of warm and cool strokes vibrating against each other. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, visible stroke economy, optical color mixing, chromatic aberration, rough texture, artistic sketch, expressive portraiture, pastel aesthetics, vibrant palette, loose gesture drawing, digital glazing, cross-hatched shading, raw mark-making.",

  "background_prompt": "An abstract, atmospheric backdrop rendered in the style of loose colored pencil and chalk pastel hatching. The scene is devoid of distinct subjects, focusing entirely on the interplay of texture and color temperature. Broad, sweeping diagonal hatch marks in {{primary_color}} weave together with lighter scumbles of {{accent_color}}, creating a sense of depth through optical mixing rather than distinct perspective. The texture mimics the grain of toothy paper, with white speckles showing through the layers of dry media. Lighting is suggested through soft gradients built from accumulated strokes, transitioning from cool shadow areas to warm, paper-white highlights. The composition is open and airy, evoking a studio atmosphere or a blurred abstract environment. Full bleed, no frame.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "An abstract, atmospheric backdrop rendered in the style of loose colored pencil and chalk pastel hatching, designed to layer behind a cutout subject. The scene focuses on the interplay of texture and color temperature, with broad, sweeping diagonal hatch marks in {{primary_color}} weaving together with lighter scumbles of {{accent_color}}. In the immediate foreground, a rough, sketchy vignette or decorative border of loose scribbles frames the central void, adding depth. The abstract background elements gently fade in opacity towards the edges, feathering softly into a solid {{background_color}} surface to ensure seamless compositing.
