  "description": "Un style dynamique de visualisation de design industriel qui imite l'esthétique énergique des croquis rapides aux marqueurs à alcool sur papier layout. Il présente des contours à l'encre assurés avec des lignes de construction visibles, des remplissages aux marqueurs striés indiquant la brillance des matériaux, et des blocs de couleurs géométriques abstraits qui ancrent la forme 3D.",
  "description_en": "A dynamic industrial design visualization style that mimics the energetic aesthetic of rapid alcohol marker sketching on layout paper. It features confident ink contours with visible construction overshoots, streaky marker fills indicating material gloss, and bold abstract geometric color blocks that anchor the 3D form.",

  "prompt": "High-fidelity industrial design rendering executed in the style of a professional rapid concept sketch using broad-tip alcohol markers and fine-point pigment liners. The image features {{subject}} constructed with impeccable three-dimensional perspective, showcasing a mastery of form and volume. The drawing is executed on a canvas of bright white layout paper that fills the entire image area edge-to-edge. The ink contours are crisp yet lively, characterized by varying line weights—thick, confident strokes define the outer silhouette to separate the object from the background, while thinner, broken lines detail internal mechanics and surface textures. Characteristic 'overshoot' lines extend slightly past intersection points, revealing the rapid, confident hand of the designer. Shading is applied with swift, layering marker strokes in shades of {{primary_color}}, allowing the stroke directionality to remain visible, creating a sense of raw artistic energy. Core shadows are deepened with cool grey overlays, while high-gloss areas are left pure white or accented with opaque white gouache to simulate reflectivity and material specularity. Behind the {{subject}}, a striking graphic element—a solid, abstract geometric block of {{accent_color}}—is placed to create depth and visual pop, painted with visible vertical marker strokes that vary in opacity. The composition is grounded by a stylized cast shadow consisting of uniform diagonal hatching. Surrounding the main form are faint, ghosted construction lines, axis guides, and handwritten annotations typical of an ideation sheet. The rendering style balances loose gestural expression with technical precision. The lighting mimics a studio setup with a strong key light from the top left, casting defined shadows. The entire composition is full bleed, with the paper texture and sketch elements extending to every corner of the frame without restriction., industrial design sketch, product design visualization, alcohol markers, copic rendering, rapid viz, gestural ink, construction lines, perspective drawing, marker streaks, design ideation, loose sketching, technical illustration, marker paper texture, design concept, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space",

  "background_prompt": "A background scene evoking a professional industrial design workspace surface, visualized as a sheet of clean white layout paper viewed from a slight angle. The scene is dominated by a large, abstract geometric shape—a rectangle or trapezoid—rendered in {{accent_color}} alcohol marker strokes. The strokes are vertical and streaky, showing the variation in ink density and the speed of application. Below this graphic element, the ground plane is defined by loose, diagonal cross-hatching lines in cool grey ink, suggesting a floor without depicting a specific object. Scattered across the periphery are faint, ghosted pencil construction lines, perspective grid fragments, and illegible handwritten design notes or dimensions in black fine liner. The lighting is bright and uniform, emphasizing the texture of the paper and the vibrancy of the marker ink. No central subject is present, only the atmospheric elements of a concept sketch environment.",
