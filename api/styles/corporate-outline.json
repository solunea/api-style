  "prompt": "A clean, minimalist digital vector illustration in the style of modern corporate editorial art, rendered with the aesthetic of hand-drawn ink on smooth paper. The image depicts {{subject}} filling the frame, defined by confident, organic black outlines that possess a slight wobble and variation, mimicking the natural stroke of a felt-tip pen or ink nib. The rendering style is strictly flat with absolutely no gradients, volumetric shading, or texture overlays. The color palette is high-contrast and limited, utilizing large fields of {{primary_color}} for main clothing or object masses, and {{accent_color}} for key details or focal points. Crucially, skin tones, paper elements, and highlight areas are rendered as pure, unmodulated white (hex #FFFFFF), creating a striking negative-space effect against the colored elements. Facial features are heavily abstracted and friendly, using simple black dots for eyes and single curved strokes for noses and mouths. The lighting is non-existent; forms are defined entirely by the black line work and flat color separation. The background environment is drawn in the same sparse, linear style, using thin black contours to suggest architecture or setting without cluttering the composition, ensuring a bright, high-key atmosphere that feels professional, informative, and optimistic. The overall visual language borrows from 'Ligne Claire' and 'Corporate Memphis' but with a sketchier, more human touch. Reinforcement tags: digital vector, hand-drawn outline, flat design, corporate art, editorial illustration, ink lines, spot color, minimalist, unshaded, white skin tones, architectural sketch style, clean silhouette, high contrast, tech blog aesthetic, professional, collaborative, blueprint aesthetic, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist environmental background illustration in a hand-drawn vector engineer style. The scene depicts a professional or architectural setting (such as an office interior, construction site, or cityscape) rendered exclusively through sparse, organic black ink outlines. The line work is confident but loose, suggesting form without dense hatching or shading. The scene is predominantly high-key and white, with selective flat fills of {{primary_color}} applied only to key structural elements or furniture to create visual rhythm. There are no characters or foreground subjects. The perspective is flat or isometric, emphasizing clarity and structure over realistic depth. The lighting is purely conceptual, defined by the white space of the 'paper' and the black contour lines. The aesthetic is clean, planned, and reminiscent of an architectural draft or a startup landing page backdrop.",

It features simplified facial features (dot eyes), the use of pure white for skin tones and negative space, and a restricted palette typical of modern tech editorial design.",

The color palette is high-contrast and limited, utilizing large fields of {{primary_color}} for main clothing or object masses, and {{accent_color}} for key details or focal points. Crucially, skin tones, paper elements, and highlight areas are rendered as solid, opaque pure white (hex #FFFFFF) pigment, ensuring they remain visible and do not become transparent. Facial features are heavily abstracted and friendly, using simple black dots for eyes and single curved strokes for noses and mouths. The lighting is non-existent; forms are defined entirely by the black line work and flat color separation. The subject is composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface, with the black ink outlines creating a crisp, hard-edged vector silhouette against the {{background_color}}. The opaque white elements of the subject stand out boldly against the {{background_color}}, maintaining the style's signature negative-space aesthetic even without a white backdrop.
