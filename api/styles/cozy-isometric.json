  "description": "Une esthétique nostalgique de pixel art 16 bits rappelant les RPG classiques de l'ère SNES ou GBA, définie par des pixels carrés distincts et une palette de couleurs vibrante et limitée. Le style présente un rendu sans contours où les formes sont sculptées par des changements de valeurs nets et un ombrage en grappes, créant une atmosphère lo-fi chaleureuse avec un éclairage contrasté et tacheté.",
  "description_en": "A nostalgic 16-bit pixel art aesthetic reminiscent of classic SNES or GBA era RPGs, defined by distinct, chunky square pixels and a vibrant, limited color palette. The style features lineless rendering where forms are sculpted by sharp value changes and cluster shading, creating a cozy, lo-fi atmosphere with dappled, high-contrast lighting.",

  "prompt": "A high-fidelity 16-bit pixel art masterpiece depicting {{subject}}, rendered with the distinct aesthetic of a golden-age retro video game. The image utilizes a coarse, visible pixel grid where every detail is constructed from individual square color blocks, strictly avoiding any anti-aliasing, smoothing, or vector curves. The rendering style is lineless; do not use black outlines to define the {{subject}}. Instead, rely on sharp, geometric transitions between distinct color values to sculpt form and volume. The lighting is dramatic and atmospheric, featuring strong directional sunlight that casts hard-edged, blocky shadows across the {{subject}}, creating a vivid contrast between the illuminated areas in warm hues and the shaded recesses in deep, cool tones. The color palette is rich and saturated, utilizing {{primary_color}} as the dominant theme with accents of {{accent_color}} to highlight details, adhering to a limited color count typical of 16-bit graphics hardware. Textures are implied through 'cluster shading'—grouping pixels of similar colors to suggest material properties without noise or gradients. The scene must be fully immersive and occupy the entire canvas area. Explicitly enforce: NO borders, NO frames, NO white margins, NO canvas edges, FULL BLEED to all four corners, the environment and {{subject}} must stretch entirely across the digital canvas. The mood is serene, lo-fi, and deeply nostalgic. reinforcement tags: pixel art, 16-bit, SNES aesthetic, retro game graphics, dot art, low-res, blocky, aliased edges, hard pixels, vibrant colors, nostalgic, lo-fi, chiptune visual, isometric influence, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",

  "background_prompt": "A detailed 16-bit pixel art environment scene featuring a sprawling landscape or interior space without any central subject. The scene is constructed from visible, chunky square pixels with a limited, saturated color palette dominated by {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The lighting is bright and directional, casting distinct, hard-edged shadows that emphasize the grid-based structure of the world. Elements like sky, ground, vegetation, or architectural details are rendered with sharp, aliased edges and cluster shading. The atmosphere is peaceful and nostalgic, evoking the background art of early 90s adventure games. No frames, no borders, full bleed coverage.",
