  "description": "Un style vibrant et expressif imitant le pastel à l'huile ou le crayon de cire sur papier à grain fort, caractérisé par des hachures directionnelles lâches et un espace négatif blanc visible. L'esthétique mêle la spontanéité de l'art naïf aux qualités de captation de la lumière de l'impressionnisme, utilisant des traits non mélangés pour construire la forme et la texture sans contours rigides.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant, expressive style mimicking oil pastel or soft wax crayon on heavy-tooth paper, characterized by loose, directional hatching and visible white negative space. The aesthetic blends the spontaneity of naive art with the light-capturing qualities of Impressionism, using unblended strokes to build form and texture without rigid outlines.",

  "prompt": "A vibrant, expressive oil pastel and wax crayon drawing on heavy-tooth textured white paper, capturing {{subject}} in a lively, naive impressionist style. The rendering technique relies entirely on loose, directional hatching and rapid gestural scribbles rather than smooth blending or solid fills. The {{subject}} is constructed through energetic, separate strokes of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, allowing the rough grain of the paper to show through as sparkling white noise between the pigment lines. There are no hard black outlines; forms are defined by the accumulation of colored marks and the contrast between the saturated crayon wax and the white page. Trees and vertical elements are rendered with upward, jagged strokes, while ground planes use horizontal or diagonal cross-hatching to suggest depth and perspective. The lighting is high-key and diffuse, implied by the preservation of the white paper as the brightest highlight, creating a sun-drenched, breezy atmosphere typical of mid-century Scandinavian illustration or David Hockney's sketchbooks. Shadows are not black but deep cool tones like indigo or forest green sketched loosely over warmer under-layers. The composition feels spontaneous and organic, with {{mood}} communicated through the frenetic yet controlled rhythm of the hand-drawn lines. The edges of the image are rough and painterly, showing the natural start-and-stop points of the crayon on the textured surface. Full bleed, intimate perspective, tactile materiality.",
  "prompt_removebg": "A vibrant, expressive oil pastel and wax crayon drawing composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface, capturing {{subject}} in a lively, naive impressionist style. The rendering technique relies entirely on loose, directional hatching and rapid gestural scribbles rather than smooth blending or solid fills.

There are no hard black outlines; forms are defined by the accumulation of colored marks. The subject's silhouette against the {{background_color}} is defined by a rough, dry-media edge where the crayon texture naturally breaks up, avoiding any artificial vector smoothness.

Shadows are not black but deep cool tones like indigo or forest green sketched loosely over warmer under-layers.

  "background_prompt": "A scenic landscape or environment rendered in a loose, expressive oil pastel and wax crayon style on textured white paper. The scene depicts a park, forest, or open space filled with vibrant, directional hatching. Tall vertical elements like trees or structures are created with upward, jagged strokes of green, ochre, and russet, while the ground plane is defined by sweeping diagonal or horizontal hatch marks in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The white of the paper shows through the gaps in the wax crayon, creating a sense of bright, diffuse daylight. There are no people or subjects, just the rhythmic, textured interplay of nature and light captured through naive, impressionistic sketching.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A scenic landscape or environment rendered in a loose, expressive oil pastel and wax crayon style, creating a backdrop for a foreground subject. The scene depicts a park, forest, or open space filled with vibrant, directional hatching in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. Tall vertical elements are created with upward, jagged strokes, while the ground plane is defined by sweeping diagonal hatch marks. In the immediate foreground, a decorative, sketchy frame or vignette made of loose crayon scribbles frames the central void, adding depth. The entire scene gently fades or feathers into a solid {{background_color}} surface at the outer edges, creating a soft, artistic transition between the textured drawing and the flat background color.",
