  "description": "Un style d'illustration vibrant fait main imitant les gribouillages spontanés à l'encre et la prise de notes visuelle. Il se caractérise par des traits de marqueur noir audacieux et expressifs, une palette de couleurs limitée avec des accents percutants, et un nuage environnant de symboles énergiques comme des gribouillis, des points d'exclamation et des formes géométriques stylisées.",
  "prompt": "A vibrant, hand-drawn ink doodle illustration of {{subject}}, executed in a charming, spontaneous sketch style reminiscent of modern tech-whimsy art and playful visual note-taking. The rendering mimics high-quality felt-tip marker or brush pen work on paper, featuring bold, confident black ink contours with slight organic variation in line weight. The linework is crisp but retains a human touch, avoiding mechanical perfection, with occasional loose scribbled hatching used for texture or filling dark areas. The {{subject}} is integrated into a dynamic composition, surrounded by an energetic explosion of creative doodle motifs: stylized flowers, striped geometric shapes, speech bubbles, floating exclamation marks, motion lines, squiggles, and handwritten-style graphic elements. The color palette is strictly limited and high-contrast: deep jet black ink defines the structure, filled with flat areas of white and vibrant pops of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} to guide the eye. There is no photorealistic shading or gradients; depth is achieved entirely through flat color blocking, overlapping forms, and the hierarchy of line thickness. The entire scene is rendered against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop, composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface for easy isolation. The edges of the {{subject}} are defined by the thick black ink outlines, creating a sharp, clean silhouette against the {{background_color}}. Elements of the composition, such as limbs, props, or floating doodle symbols, are explicitly allowed to break out of the scene frame and overflow the central arrangement, creating a dynamic, unconstrained look. Reinforcement tags: doodle art, hand-drawn style, ink illustration, marker sketch, bold lines, vector-like clarity, creative energy, playful, whimsical, flat color, graphic design, visual thinking, high contrast, clean shapes, energetic composition, subject breaks frame, scene overflow, isolated on color, die-cut aesthetic.",

  "background_prompt": "A playful, seamless background pattern composed entirely of hand-drawn ink doodle elements and abstract shapes. The scene features a scattered arrangement of stylized flowers, striped geometric blocks, squiggles, motion lines, and small floating symbols like dots and stars. The rendering style uses bold, expressive black marker lines. Pops of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} fill specific shapes to create rhythm and visual interest. Added to the foreground is a decorative, sketchy frame element made of loose ink lines and geometric doodle shapes that borders the empty center, creating a window for a subject.
