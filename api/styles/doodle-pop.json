  "description": "Un style d'illustration ludique et dessiné à la main qui imite les croquis au marqueur numérique avec des contours à l'encre gras et d'épaisseur variable et des aplats de couleurs. Caractérisé par une anatomie simplifiée, des symboles émotifs flottants (points d'exclamation, bulles de dialogue) et des motifs abstraits décoratifs comme des rayures et des fleurs, typiques de l'image de marque des blogs technologiques modernes.",
  "prompt": "A high-contrast digital ink illustration rendered in a sketchy editorial doodle style, featuring {{subject}}. The medium mimics a felt-tip marker on smooth paper, defined by confident, variable-width black outlines that exhibit slight organic jitter and tapered endpoints, rejecting perfect geometric vector precision for a hand-drawn aesthetic. The rendering is strictly 2D flat design with zero shading, gradients, or depth mapping. The color palette is extremely limited, utilizing jet black for all contours and primary details, paper-white for negative space, and {{accent_color}} as a singular pop-color for focal points and decorative fills. The composition is dynamic and exploded, surrounding the {{subject}} with a chaotic but balanced array of floating graphic elements: handwritten text snippets, emotive symbols like exclamation points and motion lines, and oversized decorative motifs including striped leaves, polka-dot geometric blocks, and abstract squiggles. Textures are flat, with visual interest created through bold hatching patterns (thick diagonal stripes) inside specific shapes rather than tonal variation. The lighting is non-existent; the image relies entirely on line weight and {{primary_color}} contrast to define form. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, conveying a sense of productivity and creative energy through the 'sketchbook' visual language. Edges are hard and crisp, simulating a high-resolution scan of an ink drawing.",

  "background_prompt": "A playful, flat-design background pattern composed of scattered editorial doodle elements. The scene features a rhythmic arrangement of abstract shapes drawn in bold black ink lines: oversized floral motifs with striped petals, floating geometric blocks filled with diagonal hatching, loose squiggles, and handwritten symbols like exclamation marks and speech bubbles. There is no central subject. The palette is restricted to black ink outlines, white fills, and touches of {{accent_color}} on a neutral surface. The style is strictly 2D and unshaded, mimicking a casual sketchbook page filled with creative brainstorming doodles. The layout creates a sense of scattered energy and 'white space' breathing room.",
