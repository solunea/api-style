  "description": "Un style d'illustration numérique ludique et énergique qui mêle la clarté de l'art vectoriel moderne à la spontanéité des croquis à main levée. Caractérisé par des contours à l'encre noire audacieux et d'épaisseur variable, une palette de couleurs strictement limitée (généralement noir, blanc et un accent vibrant), et une composition encombrée de symboles expressifs flottants comme des gribouillis, des points d'exclamation et des motifs géométriques.",
  "prompt": "Digital hand-drawn vector illustration in a playful corporate sketchnote style. The medium mimics bold felt-tip marker ink on smooth cardstock, characterized by thick, confident black contours with slight organic wobble and pressure-sensitive tapering, avoiding rigid geometric perfection. The {{subject}} is centered and integrated into a dynamic cluster of abstract shapes, rendered with simplified, friendly features and clean flat fills. The color palette is strictly limited to deep ink black, pure white, and vibrant flat blocks of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, with absolutely no gradients, shading, or realistic lighting. The scene is densely packed with 'doodle' energy: floating squiggles, energetic motion lines, handwritten-style exclamations, stippled dots, and geometric background elements like diagonal black-and-white striped blocks and oversized stylized botanical leaves. The composition is flat and graphic, emphasizing shape hierarchy over depth. The background is a solid, warm off-white or cream paper tone that fills the frame completely. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, productive, and creative, evoking the feeling of a brainstorming session or a startup hero image. Every element has a crisp, sticker-like quality with high contrast. Reinforcement tags: playful doodle art, corporate memphis influence, bold line work, sketchnoting style, flat color, vector illustration, high contrast, limited palette, graphic design, spot illustration, ink outlines, geometric patterns, creative energy, visual thinking, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

The composition is a dense arrangement of graphic elements including oversized stylized botanical leaves with bold black outlines, geometric blocks filled with diagonal black-and-white stripes, and scattered energy markers like squiggles, spirals, and stippled dots. The palette is high-contrast, utilizing deep black ink lines, white negative space, and flat accents of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} on a warm cream paper texture. The lighting is completely flat and graphic. There is no central subject, only the energetic pattern of creative brainstorming symbols filling the space.",
  "description_en": "A playful, high-energy digital illustration style that blends the clarity of modern vector art with the spontaneity of hand-drawn sketchnotes. Characterized by bold, varying-width black ink outlines, a strict limited color palette (typically black, white, and one vibrant accent), and a composition cluttered with expressive floating symbols like squiggles, exclamation marks, and geometric patterns.",
