  "description": "Une esthétique mixte vibrante qui fusionne la peinture numérique réaliste avec des éléments de design graphique bruts et chaotiques, caractérisée par des contours à l'encre noire audacieux qui abstraient la silhouette du sujet. Le style imite un journal d'art analogique ou un fanzine, superposant typographie vintage, trames de demi-teintes et textures de papier vieilli avec un portrait haute fidélité.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant mixed-media aesthetic that fuses realistic digital painting with raw, chaotic graphic design elements, characterized by bold, sweeping black ink contours that abstract the subject's silhouette. The style mimics an analog art journal or zine, layering vintage typography, halftone patterns, and distressed paper textures with high-fidelity portraiture.",

  "prompt": "Avant-garde mixed media collage illustration combining high-fidelity digital oil painting with raw graphic design elements and analog textures, full bleed, no border. The {{subject}} is the central focal point, rendered with a striking duality: the face is painted with soft, realistic sophistication, utilizing complex skin tone modulation with underpainting in violet and {{accent_color}}, featuring realistic subsurface scattering, distinct tear-duct highlights, and soft shadow transitions consistent with studio butterfly lighting. In sharp contrast, the hair and outer silhouette are deconstructed into bold, heavy, gestural black ink contours, varying significantly in thickness like a wide calligraphic brush or giant marker, creating abstract negative spaces. The composition is aggressively layered with 'zine-style' graphic debris: fragments of vintage serif typography, circular postmarks, torn paper edges, and bold geometric shapes in flat {{primary_color}}. The clothing is stylized with coarse halftone dot patterns (Ben-Day dots) and striped vector textures that flatten the form against the realistic face. The background is a textured surface resembling aged off-white cardstock or watercolor paper, stained with washes of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The lighting is physically accurate on the face—soft, diffuse, neutral temperature—but non-existent on the graphic overlays, creating a surreal depth disparity. Texture plays a crucial role, with visible paper grain, risograph noise, ink bleed, and screen-print misalignment artifacts unifying the disparate elements. The overall atmosphere is {{mood}}, blending urban grit with artistic elegance. Reinforcement tags: mixed media, collage art, neo-dada, expressive ink wash, realistic face abstract hair, typography overlay, halftone textures, risograph aesthetic, bold graphic lines, paper grain, eclectic composition, contemporary illustration, fashion editorial style, artistic chaos, vibrant accents, textural contrast, analog feel, digital painting, poster art, visual noise, full bleed.",

  "background_prompt": "A chaotic abstract background of mixed media collage textures and vintage graphic design elements, full bleed. The scene is built on a base of aged, textured off-white paper or cardstock with visible fibers and slight yellowing. Scattered across the surface are layers of distressed typography, fragments of serif letters, circular rubber stamp postmarks, and torn paper scraps. Bold, flat geometric shapes and swatches of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} create visual rhythm without representing specific objects. Coarse halftone dot patterns and screen-print textures add grit and noise. The lighting is flat and graphic, treating the surface as a 2D canvas rather than a 3D space, emphasizing the tactile quality of the paper grain, ink splatters, and risograph-style imperfections.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A chaotic abstract background of mixed media collage textures and vintage graphic design elements, rendered against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop. The scene features layers of distressed typography, fragments of serif letters, circular rubber stamp postmarks, and torn paper scraps arranged to create a central void for a subject. Bold, flat geometric shapes and swatches of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} create visual rhythm. A decorative foreground frame is formed by sweeping, thick black ink strokes and scattered confetti-like geometric shapes that float in front of the composition, adding depth. The collage elements fade softly into the {{background_color}} at the outer edges, or are cut with hard graphic lines to contrast with the {{background_color}}, maintaining the look of a cutout assemblage floating in space.",
