  "description": "Un style visuel hyper-tactile imitant des miniatures en laine feutrée capturées par macrophotographie haut de gamme. Il se caractérise par des fibres visibles, des bords doux et duveteux, une palette de couleurs pastel et un flou de profondeur de champ (bokeh) prononcé pour créer une sensation convaincante de petite échelle et de chaleur douillette.",
  "description_en": "A hyper-tactile visual style mimicking needle-felted wool miniatures captured through high-end macro photography. It features visible stray fibers, soft fuzzy edges, a pastel color palette, and aggressive depth-of-field blur (bokeh) to create a convincing sense of small scale and cozy warmth.",

  "prompt": "Hyper-realistic macro photography of a handcrafted needle-felted wool miniature diorama, occupying the entire frame with full bleed composition and no borders. The scene features {{subject}} rendered as a charming, soft sculpture made of compressed dyed sheep's wool. The texture is the defining element: visible stray fibers sticking out from the surface, a fuzzy halo effect backlighting the edges, and the matted, organic irregularity of dry-felted craftsmanship. There are no hard vector lines; shapes are defined by volume and color blocking with soft, fibrous transitions. The facial features are simplified and cute, utilizing small felted dots or beads for eyes, evoking a 'kawaii' or 'chibi' aesthetic. The lighting is a soft, diffuse studio setup, likely a large softbox overhead with gentle fill, creating a shadowless, airy atmosphere that emphasizes the tactility of the material without harsh contrast. The color palette is dominated by {{primary_color}} in the main forms, accented by touches of {{accent_color}}, all presented in soft, matte pastel tones typical of dyed wool. The camera mimics a macro lens with an extremely shallow depth of field; the {{subject}} is in sharp focus while the foreground and background dissolve into a creamy, dreamy bokeh blur. The environment consists of soft, rolling mounds of felted fabric representing terrain or clouds. The mood is {{mood}}, conveying innocence and comfort. The entire image feels touchable, warm, and painstakingly handmade. Reinforcement tags: needle felting, dry felting, macro photography, tilt-shift effect, wool texture, stray fibers, fuzz, soft focus, bokeh, pastel colors, craftcore, stop-motion aesthetic, miniature scale, tactile surface, matte finish, diffuse lighting, high key, cute, kawaii, chibi, realistic material render, volumetric softness, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",
  "background_prompt": "A soft-focus macro background scene of a needle-felted wool world, devoid of any main characters. The environment is composed of rolling hills and organic shapes made from soft, matted felt fabric in shades of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The texture is fuzzy and fibrous, with visible stray hairs catching the light. The lighting is bright, diffuse, and shadowless, evoking a sunny studio setting. The depth of field is extremely shallow, creating a creamy bokeh effect where distant felted shapes (resembling trees, clouds, or abstract scenery) blur into soft washes of pastel color. The foreground features out-of-focus woolly textures that frame the bottom edge, enhancing the sense of miniature scale. The atmosphere is airy, gentle, and undeniably cozy.",
