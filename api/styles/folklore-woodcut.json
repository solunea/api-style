Caractérisée par une palette duotone strictement limitée, des textures bruyantes et pointillées, et des formes définies par un espace négatif soustractif sur un fond de papier fibreux.",
  "description_en": "A nostalgic aesthetic mimicking mid-century matchbox labels and coarse Risograph printing. Characterized by a strictly limited duotone palette, heavy stippled noise textures, and forms defined by subtractive negative space carving against a fibrous paper background.",
