  "description": "Un style d'illustration distinctif mêlant le design graphique du milieu du siècle à l'art populaire d'Europe de l'Est et à l'esthétique de la linogravure. Caractérisé par une palette restreinte à fort contraste (généralement des bleus profonds et des rouges vifs), des formes géométriques plates décorées de motifs internes et une texture de grain tactile rappelant la risographie ou la sérigraphie.",
  "description_en": "A distinctive illustration style blending mid-century modern graphic design with Eastern European folk art and linocut aesthetics. Characterized by a high-contrast, restricted palette (typically deep blues and vibrant reds), flat geometric shapes decorated with internal patterns, and a heavy, tactile grain texture resembling risograph or screen printing.",

  "prompt": "A striking, flat-style digital screen print illustration of {{subject}}, executed with the aesthetic of mid-century Scandinavian folk art and Polish Wycinanki paper cutting. The image must occupy the entire canvas with full bleed coverage, extending edge-to-edge with absolutely no borders, frames, or white margins. The rendering technique mimics a textured linocut or risograph print, where the {{subject}} is constructed from bold, solid blocks of color without any gradients or shading. The forms are simplified into stylized geometric silhouettes, heavily decorated with internal patterns such as floral motifs, dots, dashes, and organic lines in contrasting ink. \n\nThe lighting is completely flat and graphical, relying on high-contrast value separation rather than shadows to define depth. The color palette is strictly limited and sophisticated: dominated by a deep, consuming midnight blue or void-black atmosphere, punctuated by large masses of {{primary_color}} and delicate accents of {{accent_color}} and stark white. \n\nThe materiality of the image is defined by a pervasive, gritty texture—visible salt-and-pepper noise, ink-starve spots, and rough paper grain that gives the digital image a tactile, hand-printed feel. Edges are sharp but slightly imperfect, mimicking the cut of scissors or the press of a stamp. The composition is 2D and decorative, ignoring realistic perspective in favor of a balanced, ornamental arrangement. The atmosphere is cozy yet slightly melancholic, evoking a whimsical storybook mood. \n\nReinforcement tags: folk art illustration, risograph style, linocut texture, flat design, mid-century modern, vector art with grain, high contrast, midnight blue background, decorative patterns, stylized geometry, wycinanki influence, scandinavian design, matte texture, screen print aesthetic, whimsical, storybook art, no gradients, solid color blocks, tactile grain, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",
  "background_prompt": "A decorative, flat-style environmental pattern inspired by nocturnal folk art and linocut prints. The scene depicts a stylized landscape or abstract botanical arrangement consisting of geometric trees, simple house silhouettes, and floating floral motifs (leaves, berries, petals). The composition is purely 2D, lacking realistic depth or perspective, arranged like a repeating textile print or a storybook backdrop. The colors are dominated by a deep midnight blue or void-black base, with scattered elements in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The texture is heavy and gritty, featuring risograph grain, ink speckles, and paper noise. No central subject, no frames, no borders—just a continuous, edge-to-edge atmospheric setting.",
