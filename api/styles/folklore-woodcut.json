  "description": "Une fusion distinctive de la gravure sur bois vintage et de l'esthétique Risograph lo-fi, caractérisée par une palette duotone stricte et un grain de texture prononcé. Le style imite l'aspect de l'encre 'affamée' sur du papier grossier, où des lignes gougées rugueuses et un bruit pointillé remplacent les dégradés lisses pour créer une atmosphère rustique et folklorique.",
  "description_en": "A distinctive fusion of vintage woodblock printing and lo-fi Risograph aesthetics, characterized by a strict duotone palette and heavy textural grain. The style mimics the look of 'starved ink' on coarse paper, where rough gouged lines and stippled noise replace smooth shading to create a rustic, folkloric atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "A vintage relief print illustration in the style of a weathered woodcut or linocut, rendered with the specific aesthetic of a two-color Risograph print. The medium mimics analog ink transfer on coarse, fibrous paper, featuring significant texture, ink starvation, and 'salt-and-pepper' noise where the ink fails to fully saturate the paper tooth. The image is a strict duotone composition occupying the full bleed of the frame with no margins. The {{subject}} is rendered primarily in a deep, desaturated {{primary_color}} ink, defining the main volume and shadow masses with heavy, gouged-looking strokes and rough hatching. There are no smooth gradients; shading is achieved entirely through stippling, cross-hatching, and the varying density of the ink texture. The secondary elements are rendered in a faded {{accent_color}} ink, used for the ground, environmental accents, or props, providing a vintage contrast to the primary figure. The lighting is non-directional and graphic, defined entirely by the binary contrast between the inked areas and the negative space. The edges of the forms are organic, jagged, and slightly distressed, mimicking the physical resistance of a carving tool against wood and the imperfection of a stamp. The composition is iconic and graphic, reminiscent of classic fantasy paperback spot illustrations or tarot symbology. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, nostalgic, and rustic. The background acts as the negative space, appearing as a textured, uncolored cream or off-white paper surface which serves as the high-key value. {{lighting}} influences the scene only by determining where the heavy ink shadows fall, creating a high-contrast, flat look without volumetric rendering. Reinforcement tags: vintage woodblock, risograph grain, duotone printing, linocut texture, rough ink bleed, stippled shading, gouge marks, folklore aesthetic, analog print, heavy paper texture, ink starvation, rustic illustration, graphic masses, no gradients, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, high contrast, tactile grunge.",
  "background_prompt": "A minimalist, textured landscape scene rendered in a vintage woodcut and Risograph style, devoid of any central figures. The environment is depicted using rough, gouged lines and stippled noise patterns. The ground and geological features are inked in a faded {{accent_color}}, while deeper shadows and vegetation are hinted at with desaturated {{primary_color}} strokes. The texture mimics 'starved ink' on coarse paper, with significant grain and salt-and-pepper noise. The composition is open and atmospheric, providing a rustic setting with high contrast and no smooth gradients, evoking a sense of ancient folklore and analog printmaking.",
