  "description": "Une esthétique d'impression risographie ou de gravure sur bois bicolore vintage, caractérisée par un grain grossier, une application d'encre à fort contraste et une absence totale de dégradés. Le style imite les illustrations ponctuelles de livres de fantasy du milieu du siècle avec des bords rugueux et texturés, des ombrages en pointillés et une palette de couleurs strictement limitée simulant le saignement de l'encre analogique sur du papier mat.",
  "description_en": "A vintage two-tone risograph or woodblock print aesthetic characterized by coarse grain, high-contrast ink application, and a distinct lack of gradients. The style mimics mid-century fantasy book spot illustrations with rough, textured edges, stippled shading, and a strictly limited color palette simulating analog ink bleed on matte paper.",

  "prompt": "A vintage two-color risograph print illustration of {{subject}}, executed with the rough, tactile aesthetic of a coarse woodblock or linocut print. The image must occupy the entire canvas edge-to-edge, full bleed with no borders or white margins. The rendering technique relies entirely on binary contrast and heavy ink saturation—there are absolutely no smooth gradients, soft shadows, or digital blending. Visuals are constructed from solid masses of {{primary_color}} ink and {{accent_color}} ink, using negative space to define contours and volume. The {{subject}} is depicted with chunky, expressive lines and rough cross-hatching that mimics the physical resistance of a carving tool. Shading is achieved through stochastic dithering, noise patterns, and stippling rather than opacity changes. The texture is gritty and fibrous, simulating the imperfections of analog printing where ink bleeds slightly into the paper grain. Lighting is graphic and high-contrast, with {{primary_color}} serving as the deep shadow and structural linework, while {{accent_color}} provides highlights and environmental details. The atmosphere is nostalgic and folk-art inspired, evoking the feel of a mid-century paperback fantasy illustration. Every element, from the {{subject}} to the background environment, is treated with the same consistent, noisy print texture, creating a unified, flat, yet deeply textured composition. Reinforcement tags: risograph style, woodblock print, linocut, two-color palette, coarse grain, stippling, dithering, analog print texture, ink bleed, rough edges, high contrast, folk art, vintage illustration, matte finish, screen print, serigraph, noise texture, tactile, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",
  "background_prompt": "A textured environmental backdrop rendered in a vintage two-color risograph or woodcut print style. The scene depicts a landscape or abstract setting composed entirely of rough, stippled ink textures in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. There are no smooth gradients; depth is suggested through the density of hatching, cross-hatching, and noise patterns. The texture mimics coarse paper grain and analog ink bleed. The composition is open and atmospheric, utilizing negative space and solid ink masses to create a sense of place without any specific focal subject. The aesthetic is gritty, matte, and reminiscent of mid-century book endpapers.",
