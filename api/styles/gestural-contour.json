  "description": "Un style d'illustration éditorial minimaliste défini par des contours noirs lâches et expressifs à l'encre sèche, associés à des blocs géométriques abstraits de couleur plate servant d'ancrage environnemental. L'esthétique équilibre un trait rapide et esquissé avec des formes vectorielles nettes et de subtils lavis de marqueur gris, évoquant une ambiance décontractée et centrée sur l'humain, typique de l'image de marque technologique moderne.",
  "description_en": "A minimalist editorial illustration style defined by loose, expressive black dry-ink contours paired with abstract, geometric blocks of flat color that act as environmental anchors. The aesthetic balances rapid, sketchy line work with clean vector-like shapes and subtle gray marker washes, evoking a casual, human-centric mood often seen in modern tech branding and storyboards.",

  "prompt": "Digital dry-ink gestural illustration and offset marker style featuring {{subject}}. The rendering technique mimics rapid, confident sketching using a textured black charcoal pencil or dry brush pen, creating lines that vary significantly in weight—thick and bold on structural curves, thin and broken on details. The line work is purposely loose, with open contours, scribbled extremities, and a sense of kinetic energy, avoiding rigid anatomical perfection in favor of expressive abstraction. Facial features are reduced to minimalist dots and sweeping curves. The subject is shaded with translucent, neutral gray marker washes that loosely follow the form, adding subtle volume without realistic lighting physics. A distinct, flat {{primary_color}} geometric block (such as a rectangle, circle, or abstract polygon) is positioned behind or interacting with the subject, serving as a symbolic prop or environmental anchor (e.g., a chair, doorway, or floor plane). This color block is slightly offset or misregistered from the inked outline, creating a playful print-like aesthetic. Small accents of {{accent_color}} appear in accessories or background scribbles. The lighting is completely flat and graphic, with no cast shadows or directional light sources, relying entirely on the contrast between the deep black ink, the vivid {{primary_color}} shape, and the stark white negative space that surrounds the figure. The texture is reminiscent of high-tooth sketch paper, with visible grain in the charcoal strokes. The composition utilizes abundant negative space to create a clean, modern editorial look that feels both professional and hand-crafted. {{mood}} atmosphere. Reinforcement tags: gestural line art, dry brush texture, charcoal sketch, flat color blocking, minimalist editorial, corporate illustration, hand-drawn aesthetic, loose ink, variable line weight, gray wash shading, abstract geometry, print misregistration effect, high contrast, rough edge, sketchpad style, unrefined strokes, playful minimalism, visual storytelling, concept sketch, marker art, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist abstract environment sketch composed of loose, sketchy black ink lines and flat geometric color blocks, devoid of any human subjects. A large, bold {{primary_color}} geometric shape (such as an asymmetrical rectangle or floating circle) anchors the composition, representing a simplified architectural element or furniture piece. Surrounding this are rapid, scribbly charcoal texture marks and faint gray washes that suggest spatial depth without detail. The background features a paper-grain texture and relies heavily on negative space, with {{accent_color}} dashed lines or dots providing rhythmic visual interest. The lighting is flat and graphic, mimicking a quick architectural concept sketch or editorial spot illustration background. No frames or borders.",
