  "prompt": "A breathtaking, high-fidelity frame from a traditional 2D animated feature film, capturing the masterfully crafted aesthetic of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. The central focus is {{subject}}, rendered with crisp, delicate dark outlines and smooth, flat cel-shading (anime style coloring) that contrasts beautifully with the environment. The color palette is dominated by natural, earthy tones with {{primary_color}} as the main thematic hue and {{accent_color}} providing vibrant highlights on the subject's details. \n\nThe background is a work of art in itself, mimicking the texture of hand-painted poster colors and opaque watercolors (gouache) on textured paper. It features incredible density and detail in foliage or architecture, with soft, impressionistic brushstrokes that suggest moss, leaves, and weathered stone. The lighting is evocative and atmospheric, specifically capturing 'komorebi'—dappled sunlight filtering through trees or windows—casting soft, dappled shadows across the scene. The mood is {{mood}}, evoking a sense of nostalgic wonder, summer memories, and serene stillness. The composition uses a slight wide-angle lens effect to place the subject within a grand, immersive environment, maintaining a sharp focus on the character while the background retains a painterly softness.\n\nreinforcement tags: Studio Ghibli style, Spirited Away aesthetic, 1990s anime, hand-drawn animation, masterpiece, 8k resolution, lush vegetation, scenic, pastoral, serene, atmospheric lighting, Tyndall effect, high quality, precise line art, matte painting background, visual storytelling.",
  "background_prompt": "A lush, hand-painted background scene in the style of a Studio Ghibli movie, featuring no characters. The scene depicts a dense, atmospheric environment (such as a forest tunnel, an old shrine, or a rural path) painted with opaque watercolors and gouache. The texture is rich and organic, showing mossy surfaces, ancient stones, and dense foliage in shades of {{primary_color}} and deep greens. Dappled sunlight filters through the canopy, creating patches of bright light and cool shadow. Hints of {{accent_color}} appear in small flowers or architectural details. The perspective is immersive, drawing the viewer into a serene, nostalgic world.",

  "prompt_removebg": "A high-fidelity reproduction of a classic Studio Ghibli animation frame featuring {{subject}}. The artistic rendering technique is traditional hand-drawn 2D animation, combining crisp cel-shaded character art with a rich, painterly background reminiscent of Kazuo Oga's work. The {{subject}} is defined by thin, consistent ink outlines, smooth matte colors, and distinct hard-edged shadows (cel shading) to create volume without excessive gradient. The color palette utilizes natural, slightly desaturated tones dominated by {{primary_color}}, with specific details highlighted in {{accent_color}}. The lighting mimics 'komorebi' (sunlight filtering through trees), casting dappled, soft light and gentle shadows across the form. The texture of the subject is smooth and clean, contrasting with the grainy, textured look of the painted environment. The atmosphere is peaceful, nostalgic, and immersive, typical of a Hayao Miyazaki film. The image is composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface to ensure sharp edge definition and easy separation from the canvas. The overall composition emphasizes a 'slice of life' moment in a fantasy setting, with a shallow depth of field effect blurring the distant elements slightly.",

The setting is a lush, overgrown environment featuring ancient stone textures, dense foliage, and mossy surfaces in shades of {{primary_color}}. Soft, dappled sunlight filters through the canopy, creating patches of brightness and deep shadow. Small {{accent_color}} wildflowers or magical artifacts are scattered subtly in the grass. The painting shows visible brushstrokes and a watercolor paper texture, fading into a soft atmospheric blur in the distance, all set against a neutral {{background_color}} base layer.",
