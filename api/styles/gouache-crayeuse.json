  "description": "Un style d'illustration de livre pour enfants charmant et moderne du milieu du siècle, défini par l'application de gouache au pinceau sec et des textures de craie de cire sur un papier à grain épais. L'esthétique présente une perspective plane et naïve avec une coloration 'éraflée' qui laisse apparaître le grain du papier, combinant des formes géométriques audacieuses avec des détails crayonnés à la main.",
  "prompt": "A highly textured digital gouache and wax crayon illustration of {{subject}} rendered in a charming, naive mid-century modern children's book style. The rendering mimics dry-brush acrylics applied to heavy-tooth watercolor paper, creating a scuffed, granular look where the white of the paper speckles through the pigment, particularly in shadow areas and large color blocks. The composition is strictly flat and orthographic, lacking deep perspective, presenting the scene like a collage of cut shapes. The {{subject}} is depicted with whimsical proportions, using bold, confident shapes filled with {{primary_color}} which has a chalky, matte finish. Fine details like hair, fur, or fabric weave are added with scratchy, imperfect colored pencil or graphite strokes in dark charcoal or {{accent_color}}. The lighting is completely flat and uniform, typical of screen printing or lithography, with no realistic volumetric shading; instead, depth is suggested through overlapping layers and slight shifts in texture density. The environment is rich and cluttered but organized, filling the frame edge-to-edge with stylized elements matching the {{mood}} atmosphere. Edges are organic and rough, characteristic of a manual dry brush or pastel stick, never vector-perfect. Colors are saturated but slightly muted, evoking a vintage 1960s palette. Reinforcement tags: dry brush gouache, wax crayon texture, heavy paper tooth, scuffed paint, mid-century modern, Mary Blair influence, Miroslav Sasek style, naive art, flat design, textured illustration, chalky finish, visible grain, whimsical character design, hand-drawn imperfections, matte color, collage aesthetic, retro storybook, graphite detailing, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A flat, whimsical interior or landscape scene rendered in a textured dry-brush gouache and crayon style, devoid of any main characters. The scene is dense with stylized environmental details like potted plants with scratchy pencil leaves, posters on a wall, or geometric buildings, all aligned to a flat 2D plane. The texture is heavy and granular, with {{primary_color}} wall tones or sky fills scuffed to reveal the paper tooth underneath. Accents in {{accent_color}} highlight small objects or architectural features. The lighting is uniform and illustration-flat, creating a cozy, retro storybook atmosphere. The composition is busy but balanced, resembling a backdrop from a 1960s animated film or a Miroslav Sasek travel book.",

The aesthetic features flat, naive perspective with 'scuffed' coloring that allows the paper grain to show through, combining bold geometric shapes with scratchy, hand-drawn pencil details.",
