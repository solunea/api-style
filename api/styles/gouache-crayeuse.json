  "description": "Un style d'illustration charmant de livre pour enfants caractérisé par des textures lourdes ressemblant au crayon de couleur, au pastel gras et à la gouache sèche sur papier rugueux. Il présente des proportions naïves et ludiques, une palette terreuse et chaleureuse, et une finition tactile faite à la main où le grain du papier est visiblement intégré dans l'ombrage.",
  "prompt": "A delightful, highly textured children's book illustration of {{subject}}, rendered in a whimsical mixed-media style combining colored pencils, wax crayons, and dry gouache. The artwork simulates a rough, tactile surface, perhaps heavy watercolor paper or cardstock, where the grain creates natural noise and white speckles within the color blocks. The {{subject}} is depicted with charming, slightly exaggerated proportions—round shapes, expressive features, and a naive, folk-art influence. The color palette is dominated by warm, comforting shades of {{primary_color}}, with scratchy, hand-drawn details and patterns in {{accent_color}}. The lighting is flat and ambient, typical of 2D illustration, relying on texture density rather than realistic shadows to create depth. Lines are imperfect and scratchy, suggesting a quick, creative hand. The composition feels cozy and intimate, evoking a sense of innocent storytelling and indie artistic flair. Reinforcement tags: textured digital painting, analog aesthetic, dry brush, scuff marks, pastel texture, matte finish, cozy atmosphere, playful character design, indie picture book, flat perspective, granular shading, vibrant yet earthy, 4k, high resolution, tactile rendering.",

Interspersed are stylized potted plants with scratchy leaf textures. The scene is rendered in {{primary_color}} tones with {{accent_color}} details, featuring heavy paper grain, dry crayon textures, and a flat, illustrative perspective suitable for a children's book setting. No central subject, only the textured environment.",

  "prompt_removebg": "A delightful, highly textured children's book illustration of {{subject}}, executed in a mixed-media style resembling dry gouache, wax crayons, and colored pencils applied to rough grain paper. The artistic rendering is whimsical and naive, featuring playful proportions, expressive features, and simplified geometric forms typical of mid-century storybook art. The surface texture is the defining characteristic: visible dry brushstrokes, scuffed wax resist effects, grainy noise, and scratchy pencil lines that create a tactile, handmade feel. The color palette is vibrant but slightly desaturated, utilizing {{primary_color}} as the dominant hue for the main subject, with energetic details and patterns in {{accent_color}}. Lighting is flat and illustrative, avoiding realistic volumetric rendering in favor of texture density and cross-hatching to suggest depth. The subject is isolated and composited against a clean {{background_color}} background, ensuring the rough, organic edges of the drawing are clearly defined against the {{background_color}} surface. The mood is cozy, creative, and nostalgic, evoking the feeling of a beloved classic picture book. No photorealism, heavy paper grain, matte finish.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A cozy, cluttered creative environment serving as a background, featuring a wall adorned with loose sketches, color swatches, and art prints in a hand-drawn style. Potted plants with textured leaves frame the scene, introducing organic shapes. The rendering style mimics dry gouache and crayon with scratchy textures, utilizing a palette of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} accents. The scene is set against a flat {{background_color}} wall surface, maintaining a 2D illustrative depth without a central subject."
