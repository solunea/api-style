  "description": "Un style d'illustration numérique vibrant qui imite l'esthétique des collages de papier déchiré et de la sérigraphie texturée, rappelant les œuvres de Ryo Takemasa et les affiches de voyage du milieu du siècle. Il présente des aplats de couleurs saturées aux bords déchiquetés et rugueux, sans dégradés, unifiés par une texture granuleuse rappelant le papier de verre.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant digital illustration style that mimics the aesthetic of torn paper collages and textured screen printing, reminiscent of Ryo Takemasa's works and mid-century travel posters. It features flat, saturated color blocks with distinctively jagged, rough edges, devoid of gradients, and unified by a heavy, sandpaper-like noise texture.",

  "prompt": "A digital illustration rendered in a flat, torn-paper collage aesthetic featuring {{subject}} dominating the composition. The visual style mimics a fusion of silkscreen printing and analog paper cutouts, characterized by shapes with jagged, irregular edges that appear hand-torn rather than vector-smooth. There are absolutely no gradients or soft transitions; every element is a solid, unmodulated plane of color. The lighting is binary and harsh, creating hard-edged, pitch-black or deep indigo shadows that contrast sharply with the illuminated surfaces, evoking the high-contrast look of midday summer sun. The color palette is highly saturated and posterized, utilizing {{primary_color}} for the dominant shapes and {{accent_color}} for striking focal details. A heavy, uniform noise texture (resembling rough sandpaper or Risograph grain) overlays the entire image, softening the digital starkness and adding tactile materiality. The composition is strictly layered: foreground, midground, and background are defined by overlapping flat shapes rather than atmospheric perspective. The mood is {{mood}}, conveyed through the stark simplicity and vibrant interplay of colors. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, edge-to-edge coloration.",

  "background_prompt": "A scenic background illustration featuring a minimalist landscape or architectural setting rendered in a torn-paper collage style. The scene is composed of flat, overlapping planes of color representing elements like rolling hills, distant mountains, or geometric building facades, all with distinctively jagged, rough edges. The sky is a solid, unmodulated block of {{primary_color}}, contrasting with terrestrial elements in {{accent_color}} and deep shadow tones. There are no gradients; depth is achieved solely through the layering of flat shapes. A heavy, grainy texture pervades the entire scene, mimicking the tactile quality of construction paper or lithographic ink. The lighting is static and directional, casting hard, geometric shadows. No foreground subject, just the immersive environment.",

The scene is composed of flat, overlapping planes of color representing elements like rolling hills, distant mountains, or geometric building facades, all with distinctively jagged, rough edges. The sky is a solid, unmodulated block of {{primary_color}}, contrasting with terrestrial elements in {{accent_color}}. The scene includes a decorative framing element in the foreground, such as a rough, torn-paper vignette or abstract geometric borders in a contrasting hue, which naturally feathers and dissolves into a solid {{background_color}} surface at the outer edges. This creates a transition from the textured scene to the clean {{background_color}} canvas. A heavy, grainy texture pervades the scene. No central subject.",
