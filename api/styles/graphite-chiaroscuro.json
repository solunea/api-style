  "description": "Un style de croquis académique traditionnel imitant le graphite tendre ou le fusain sur du papier texturé. Il se définit par des hachures diagonales énergiques pour créer la densité des ombres, un éclairage très contrasté où le papier brut sert de rehaut, et un tracé gestuel assuré sans estompage lisse.",
  "description_en": "A traditional academic sketching style mimicking soft graphite or charcoal on textured paper. It is defined by energetic diagonal hatching to build shadow density, high-contrast lighting where the raw paper serves as the highlight, and confident, gestural line work without smooth blending.",

  "prompt": "A masterful traditional graphite pencil sketch of {{subject}} rendered in a raw, academic life-drawing style. The medium appears to be soft lead pencil (4B-6B) or charcoal stick applied to textured, warm-toned archival paper. The visual language is defined entirely by energetic, directional hatching—series of rapid, parallel diagonal lines that carve out shadow and volume without the use of smooth blending, smudging, or digital gradients. The {{subject}} is captured with a mix of heavy, pressure-sensitive contours and loose, gestural construction lines that suggest movement and spontaneity, emphasizing the artist's hand. The lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, strictly adhering to chiaroscuro principles; deep shadows are rendered with dense, multi-layered cross-hatching that obscures detail in the darks, while highlights are achieved purely through the untouched negative space of the paper, creating a luminous effect. The texture is tactile and gritty, showcasing the heavy tooth of the paper and the friable, dry quality of the charcoal or graphite medium. The composition occupies the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space, ensuring the environment and atmospheric strokes extend fully to all four corners. The background consists of broad, sweeping strokes that suggest a setting without resolving into sharp focus, creating a vignetted atmosphere that fills the canvas edge-to-edge. The aesthetic is monochromatic, utilizing a spectrum of values from pitch black to varying shades of grey, anchored by the underlying cream or beige tone of the paper substrate. Every mark feels deliberate yet rapid, capturing the essence of a live drawing session with urgency and weight. graphite sketch, charcoal drawing, pencil art, cross-hatching, directional strokes, academic study, life drawing, rough sketch, textured paper, paper grain, high contrast, chiaroscuro, monochromatic, traditional media, analog style, gestural lines, unblended shading, raw texture, sketchbook aesthetic, 2B pencil, heavy contour, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",

  "background_prompt": "A highly textured, atmospheric background scene rendered in the style of a rough graphite sketch on coarse paper. The composition focuses on abstract environmental details and lighting effects without any central subject. Broad, energetic diagonal hatching strokes sweep across the surface, creating gradients of shadow and light that suggest depth and spatial volume. The palette is strictly monochromatic, using {{primary_color}} as the deep shadow tone and {{accent_color}} as the paper highlight tone to mimic the look of charcoal on toned paper. The grain of the paper is visible throughout, interacting with the dry, friable pencil marks. The scene is purely atmospheric, evoking the corner of a room or a shadowed studio space, with light filtering through to hit the textured surface.",
