  "description": "Une interprétation numérique riche de l'impressionnisme français, caractérisée par un travail au pinceau en impasto lourd, des couleurs brisées vibrantes et une attention particulière à la lumière se reflétant sur les surfaces. Ce style imite les techniques de peinture à l'huile 'mouillé sur mouillé' de Claude Monet, utilisant des touches lâches et rythmiques pour définir les formes sans contours durs.",
  "description_en": "A rich digital interpretation of French Impressionism featuring heavy impasto brushwork, vibrating broken color, and a focus on light reflecting off surfaces. The style mimics the wet-on-wet oil techniques of Claude Monet, utilizing loose, rhythmic strokes to define form without harsh outlines.",

  "prompt": "Heavy body impasto oil painting style inspired by Claude Monet's Nymphéas series and late French Impressionism, featuring {{subject}} immersed in a textured, atmospheric environment. The rendering technique utilizes thick, visible brushstrokes and palette knife applications, creating a tactile surface where paint ridges catch the simulated light. There are no hard outlines; forms are defined by the juxtaposition of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} dabs, using optical mixing and divisionism to create vibrancy. The lighting is diffuse and shimmering, suggestive of {{lighting}} with specular highlights represented by pure white and pastel impasto peaks. Shadows are not black but composed of deep purples, blues, and cool greens, creating a luminous shadow effect. The composition is fluid and organic, with the background and foreground blended through loose, directional strokes that mimic the ripples of water or the rustle of foliage. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, conveyed through the softness of the edges and the harmonious vibration of the color palette. Textural details include simulated canvas weave and the glossy sheen of wet oil paint. The image is full bleed, filling the entire frame with this painterly aesthetic.",
  "prompt_removebg": "Heavy body impasto oil painting style inspired by Claude Monet's Nymphéas series and late French Impressionism, featuring {{subject}} isolated and rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes and palette knife applications. The subject is composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface. The rendering creates a tactile surface where paint ridges catch the simulated light.

Shadows within the subject are not black but composed of deep purples, blues, and cool greens. The edges of the {{subject}} are not vector-sharp but exhibit a natural, painterly roughness, with loose brushstrokes and paint splatters gently interacting with the {{background_color}} backdrop to maintain the illusion of a wet oil painting on a solid surface.",
  "background_prompt": "A textured, impressionistic background scene depicting a reflective water surface or lush garden atmosphere without any central subject. The scene is rendered in thick impasto oil paint with visible brushstrokes creating a sense of movement and ripples. Dominant tones of {{primary_color}} blend with flashes of {{accent_color}} through optical mixing. The composition focuses on the interplay of light and texture, with abstract reflections, floating organic shapes suggestive of lily pads or foliage, and a serene, atmospheric depth. The lighting is soft and natural, creating shimmering highlights on the textured paint ridges.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A textured, impressionistic background scene depicting a reflective water surface or lush garden atmosphere without any central subject, rendered in thick impasto oil paint with visible brushstrokes. Dominant tones of {{primary_color}} blend with flashes of {{accent_color}}. In the foreground, a loose, painterly vignette or ornamental frame made of abstract brushstrokes and paint dabs borders the image, adding depth. The center of the scene gradually fades into a flat {{background_color}} surface, creating a soft, feathered transition where the impressionist texture dissolves into the solid {{background_color}}, allowing for easy compositing of a subject in the center.",
