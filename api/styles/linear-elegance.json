  "prompt": "A sophisticated minimalist illustration of {{subject}} executed in a masterfully fluid continuous line art style. The artwork features organic, unbroken black ink contours that define the form with elegance and simplicity, utilizing ample negative space to suggest volume without shading. The line weight is consistent, resembling a fine-tip archival marker or fountain pen gliding across the surface. Soft, translucent watercolor washes in {{accent_color}} provide a delicate splash of color, loosely following the contours or highlighting focal points without filling the shapes completely, adding a dreamlike, hand-painted quality. The underlying texture mimics high-quality cold-press watercolor paper with visible grain and organic irregularities. The composition is centered and balanced, emphasizing the purity of the line work and the abstraction of the {{subject}}. The color palette is primarily monochromatic ink against the paper, with {{primary_color}} used for any additional defining lines. The lighting is flat and uniform, typical of vector illustration or scanned ink drawings, ensuring high contrast between the dark lines and the surface. The overall aesthetic is modern, chic, and understated. The image is composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface to facilitate easy background removal while maintaining the paper texture edges. No complex shading, no photorealism, purely graphic and artistic.",

  "background_prompt": "A macro close-up of high-quality textured art paper in a shade of {{background_color}}. The surface exhibits a subtle, organic grain similar to cold-press watercolor paper or heavy cardstock. Faint, abstract watercolor washes or ink splatters in {{accent_color}} and {{primary_color}} frame the edges gently, leaving the center open and clean. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the tactile quality of the paper fiber without creating harsh shadows. Minimalist, artistic stationery background.",
