  "description": "Un style d'illustration contemporain qui mélange des aplats de couleurs audacieux avec un trait délicat et esquissé ainsi que des textures sèches et crayeuses. L'esthétique imite l'art éditorial numérique moderne avec une sensation artisanale faussement analogique, utilisant une géométrie simplifiée, des bords rugueux et une palette vibrante mais mate rappelant l'impression risographique.",
  "description_en": "A contemporary illustration style that blends flat, bold color blocking with delicate, sketchy linework and dry, chalky textures. The aesthetic mimics modern digital editorial art with a faux-analog, hand-crafted feel, utilizing simplified geometry, rough edges, and a vibrant yet matte palette reminiscent of risograph printing.",

  "prompt": "A high-end contemporary editorial illustration of {{subject}}, rendered in a distinctively naive and textured flat art style. The image must occupy the entire canvas full bleed, edge-to-edge, with no borders or margins. The visual execution mimics a blend of digital vector shapes and analog dry media. The {{subject}} is constructed from solid, flat blocks of color with distinctively rough, dry-brush edges, resembling the texture of chalk, crayon, or oil pastel rubbed onto coarse paper. These color shapes are overlaid with thin, jittery, fine-point black ink lines that act as loose contours and internal details; the linework is intentionally imperfect, possessing a nervous, sketchy quality akin to a graphite pencil or a rapid pen sketch, sometimes detaching slightly from the color fill to emphasize the hand-drawn aesthetic. The lighting is completely flat with no volumetric shading, gradients, or cast shadows, relying entirely on the contrast between the color blocks to define form. The color palette utilizes {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} in a manner reminiscent of risograph or screen printing—vibrant, matte, and slightly desaturated. The surface texture is palpable, featuring a consistent paper grain or noise overlay that unifies the composition. The overall atmosphere is {{mood}}, clean, and whimsical, typical of modern tech blog illustrations or high-brow magazine spots. Reinforcement tags: contemporary editorial illustration, naive art style, flat design with texture, dry brush edges, crayon texture, jittery linework, fine ink outlines, matte finish, risograph aesthetic, textured vector, paper grain, folk art influence, simplified geometry, playful minimalism, graphic shapes, screen print style, unshaded, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist environmental scene rendered in a naive, textured editorial illustration style. The composition features abstract landscape elements or architectural shapes constructed from flat blocks of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, completely devoid of shading or gradients. The forms have rough, dry-brush edges resembling crayon on paper, and are detailed with sparse, jittery fine-point black ink lines. The scene suggests a {{mood}} atmosphere through simplified geometry and ample negative space, with a visible paper grain texture overlaying the entire image. No central subject, just a cohesive, flat-style backdrop.",
