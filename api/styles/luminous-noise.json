  "description": "Une esthétique numérique minimaliste définie par un clair-obscur discret, où les sujets émergent de vides noirs absolus illuminés par des dégradés doux à l'aérographe aux teintes néon. Le style repose fortement sur une superposition uniforme de grain de film à haute sensibilité ou de bruit numérique pour créer une texture tactile et atmosphérique rappelant la synthwave mélancolique ou les impressions risographiques lo-fi.",
  "description_en": "A minimalist digital aesthetic defined by stark low-key chiaroscuro, where subjects emerge from pitch-black voids illuminated by soft, neon-hued airbrush gradients. The style relies heavily on a uniform, high-ISO film grain or digital noise overlay to create a tactile, atmospheric texture reminiscent of moody synthwave or lo-fi risograph prints.",

  "prompt": "Contemporary digital airbrush illustration rendered with a heavy, uniform monochromatic noise texture. The composition is strictly low-key and minimalist, featuring {{subject}} emerging from an infinite, crushing pitch-black void. There are absolutely no outlines or line work; the form of {{subject}} is sculpted entirely through soft, volumetric light and shadow. A single, directional light source—reminiscent of a cinematic spotlight or a projector beam—casts a luminous, ethereal glow across the subject, creating ultra-smooth gradients that transition seamlessly from intense {{primary_color}} in the highlights to a cooler {{accent_color}} in the mid-tones, finally dissolving into the deep black background. The lighting creates a subsurface scattering effect, making the surface of {{subject}} appear semi-translucent, like frosted glass, bioluminescent skin, or matte resin. The render style mimics the soft blending of vector mesh tools combined with the grit of ISO 3200 film grain or risograph dithering. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, silent, and introspective, evoking a sense of digital solitude and liminal space. The color palette is strictly limited to the neon gradients against the black negative space, with no ambient fill light, ensuring maximum contrast and drama. The silhouette is crisp against the void, but the internal details are softened by the diffuse lighting and granular texture.",
  "prompt_removebg": "Digital airbrush illustration with heavy stippled noise texture and volumetric gradient shading, featuring {{subject}} rendered as a luminous, semi-translucent form. The rendering technique mimics a blend of 1980s airbrush art and modern lo-fi digital aesthetics, utilizing a heavy, uniform monochromatic film grain (ISO 3200) to create tactile surface grit over smooth color transitions. The lighting is internal and volumetric, creating a subsurface scattering effect where the {{subject}} glows from within, with no external key light source, resulting in a self-illuminated silhouette. The color palette employs a vertical gradient map, transitioning seamlessly from a vibrant {{primary_color}} at the base to a deep {{accent_color}} at the top, fading into shadow near the edges to define volume. The form is defined by soft falloff rather than hard outlines, yet the outer perimeter remains distinct and sharp for compositing. The image is rendered against a clean, flat {{background_color}} backdrop, ensuring high contrast between the glowing subject and the background for effortless extraction. The edges of the {{subject}} are treated with a tight anti-aliasing pass, avoiding excessive bloom or lens flare spill that would contaminate the {{background_color}} area. Atmosphere is melancholic, introspective, and futuristic.

  "background_prompt": "An infinite, featureless pitch-black void designed as pure negative space to maximize contrast with foreground luminosity. The darkness is not a flat hex code but possesses a rich, tactile quality due to a heavy overlay of uniform digital noise and film grain. Very faint, almost imperceptible atmospheric gradients of deep {{primary_color}} may linger at the extreme edges to suggest vast, cavernous depth, but the central area remains an abyss of absolute shadow, providing a stark canvas for neon light interaction.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A minimalist, textured abstract environment featuring a deep, atmospheric void of {{background_color}}. The background is treated with a heavy, uniform monochromatic grain overlay to match the subject's materiality. Subtle, almost imperceptible vertical gradients of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} drift through the darkness like faint smoke or distant nebula gas, strictly kept in the low-value range to maintain a dark, moody atmosphere without overpowering the foreground. No distinct shapes or objects, only texture and deep color atmosphere.",
