  "description": "Un style d'illustration 3D tactile imitant l'aspect de l'argile douce sculptée à la main ou de la pâte à modeler mate. L'esthétique présente une géométrie lisse et arrondie avec des volumes gonflés, rendue avec une illumination globale de haute qualité pour créer une finition confortable et non brillante qui semble physiquement palpable.",
  "description_en": "A tactile 3D illustration style mimicking the look of soft, hand-sculpted clay or matte plasticine. The aesthetic features smooth, rounded geometry with inflated volumes, rendered with high-quality global illumination to create a cozy, non-glossy finish that feels physically touchable.",

  "prompt": "High-fidelity 3D digital rendering in the style of soft claymorphism and matte plasticine modeling, featuring {{subject}} as the central sculptural element. The rendering technique simulates physically based materials with a distinct lack of specularity, resulting in a velvety, dry-matte finish reminiscent of unglazed ceramic, high-density foam, or smooth modeling dough. The {{subject}} is constructed with inflated, voluminous geometry, avoiding all sharp vertices and hard edges in favor of organic, marshmallow-like curves and soft bevels that suggest a playful, tactile malleability. The lighting setup is a sophisticated studio environment using large, diffused area lights to cast gentle, feathery shadows and rich ambient occlusion, ensuring there are no harsh blacks or overexposed highlights. The color palette is strictly controlled, utilizing {{primary_color}} for the main volumetric forms, accented by {{accent_color}} for small details or props, and set against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop. The image features the {{subject}} composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface, where the base of the object casts a realistic, soft contact shadow onto the {{background_color}} plane to ground the figure in 3D space without a surrounding environment. The edges of the {{subject}} are crisp yet rounded, separating clearly from the {{background_color}} background while maintaining the illusion of three-dimensional depth. A subtle, uniform film grain or noise texture is applied to the object to reduce the digital sterility and enhance the analog, stop-motion feel. The perspective is slightly isometric or orthographic, emphasizing the solidity and weight of the forms. render 3d, octane render, cinema 4d, blender cycles, clay material, matte finish, soft illumination, minimal design, toy-like proportions, smooth shading, ambient occlusion, global illumination, pastel tones, high poly, volumetric, tactile texture",

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist 3D environment rendered in a matte plasticine style, devoid of any central subject.
