  "description": "Ce style simule l'illusion optique de la photographie à bascule (tilt-shift), transformant des sujets grandeur nature en charmants modèles réduits rappelant des jouets. Il repose sur une profondeur de champ extrêmement faible avec un flou prononcé en haut et en bas, une saturation vibrante et des perspectives isométriques en plongée pour imiter l'apparence d'un diorama physique ou d'une maquette architecturale.",
  "description_en": "This style simulates the optical illusion of tilt-shift photography, transforming full-scale subjects into charming, toy-like miniature models. It relies on an extreme shallow depth of field with heavy top-and-bottom bokeh, vibrant saturation, and high-angle isometric perspectives to mimic the look of a physical diorama or architectural scale model.",

  "prompt": "Photorealistic tilt-shift photography style rendering of {{subject}} appearing as a highly detailed miniature scale model. The image must occupy the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space: NO borders, NO frames, NO white margins, NO canvas edges, FULL BLEED to all four corners, the environment must stretch entirely across the canvas. The visual language mimics a physical diorama or high-end architectural model captured with a specialized tilt-shift lens. The {{subject}} is presented in a high-angle, semi-isometric perspective to enhance the illusion of smallness. The most defining feature is the extreme shallow depth of field: the foreground and background (top and bottom thirds of the image) are heavily blurred with creamy, optical lens bokeh, while a narrow horizontal strip in the center remains razor-sharp. Textures within the focal plane appear tactile but slightly simplified, resembling painted resin, matte plastic, die-cast metal, or flocking, rather than gritty real-world grit. Lighting is bright, warm, and slightly artificial, reminiscent of studio softboxes or golden-hour sunlight hitting a tabletop set, creating distinct, sharp shadows and specular highlights on the 'tiny' surfaces. Colors are punched up with high saturation and contrast, making {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} elements pop with a toy-like vibrancy. The atmosphere is quiet, static, and contained, evoking the feeling of a preserved, tiny world. The rendering creates a sense of tangible materiality, as if the viewer could reach out and pick up the {{subject}}. Reinforcement tags: tilt-shift, miniature effect, diorama, scale model, shallow depth of field, macro photography, bokeh, isometric view, toy-like, photorealistic, resin texture, high angle, vibrant saturation, optical illusion, selective focus, miniature faking, plastic texture, model set, studio lighting, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",

  "background_prompt": "A completely out-of-focus, blurred backdrop representing a distant environment seen through a tilt-shift lens. The scene creates a wash of abstract shapes and colors, primarily in shades of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, resembling distant city lights, foliage, or a studio environment turned into soft, hexagonal bokeh circles. The lighting suggests a bright, warm overhead source, but no specific objects are discernible due to the extreme blur, creating a dreamy, miniature atmosphere.",
