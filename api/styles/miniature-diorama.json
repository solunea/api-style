  "description": "Un style visuel distinctif qui simule l'effet de maquette grâce à des techniques de photographie à bascule et décentrement (tilt-shift) et une esthétique macro. Il transforme des sujets grandeur nature en modèles réduits ressemblant à des jouets en utilisant une très faible profondeur de champ, une saturation des couleurs élevée et une perspective isométrique en plongée.",
  "description_en": "A distinctive visual style that simulates miniature faking through the use of tilt-shift photography techniques and macro lens aesthetics. It transforms life-sized subjects into toy-like scale models using extreme shallow depth of field, high color saturation, and a specific high-angle isometric perspective.",

  "prompt": "Photorealistic tilt-shift photography aesthetic rendering {{subject}} as a high-fidelity miniature scale model diorama. The image utilizes an extreme shallow depth of field consistent with macro photography (simulating an f/1.8 aperture on a large format sensor), creating a distinct horizontal plane of razor-sharp focus while the foreground and background dissolve into heavy, creamy Gaussian and bokeh blur. The {{subject}} appears constructed from high-quality model materials: matte-painted resin, structured thermoplastics, and hand-detailed textures that mimic real-world weathering but at a 1:87 scale. Lighting is configured as {{lighting}}, casting realistic, scale-appropriate shadows that emphasize the dimensional relief of the model, with specular highlights suggesting semi-gloss finishes on metallic, glass, or wet surfaces. The color palette is hyper-saturated and vibrant, reminiscent of toy packaging or architectural rendering, dominated by {{primary_color}} in the focal areas and {{accent_color}} providing striking contrast in the illuminated details, shifting towards cooler, muted tones in the blurred periphery. The composition mimics an isometric projection typical of architectural modeling, looking down from a high angle to reinforce the 'God's eye view' of a tiny world. Material textures are tactile but smoothed, lacking the gritty noise of full-scale reality, replacing it with the sheen of painted plastic or die-cast metal. The atmosphere conveys a mood of {{mood}}, utilizing color grading that enhances the warmth of lights and the cool depth of shadows. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, tilt-shift, miniature faking, diorama aesthetic, macro lens, isometric view, shallow depth of field, bokeh, high saturation, toy effect, scale model, resin texture, volumetric lighting, photorealistic render, octane render, sharp focus midground, blurred foreground, blurred background, architectural model style.",
  "prompt_removebg": "Photorealistic tilt-shift photography aesthetic rendering {{subject}} as a high-fidelity miniature scale model diorama, composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface. The image utilizes an extreme shallow depth of field consistent with macro photography, creating a distinct horizontal plane of razor-sharp focus on the subject. The {{subject}} appears constructed from high-quality model materials: matte-painted resin, structured thermoplastics, and hand-detailed textures that mimic real-world weathering but at a 1:87 scale. Lighting is configured as {{lighting}}, casting realistic, scale-appropriate contact shadows that ground the model firmly onto the {{background_color}} floor, with specular highlights suggesting semi-gloss finishes. The color palette is hyper-saturated and vibrant, dominated by {{primary_color}} in the focal areas and {{accent_color}} providing striking contrast. The composition mimics an isometric projection typical of architectural modeling, looking down from a high angle. The subject's edges are treated with a sophisticated extraction: the focal plane edges are crisp and anti-aliased against the {{background_color}}, while the receding parts of the model (top and bottom) exhibit a soft, optical defocus that naturally blends into the {{background_color}}, preserving the macro lens illusion.

  "background_prompt": "A completely out-of-focus background environment representing a distant cityscape or landscape, rendered in the style of a macro photography backdrop or diorama matte painting. The scene is an abstract wash of heavy bokeh circles (circles of confusion) and diffused light shapes, utilizing {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} to suggest distant lights, traffic, or structures without any sharp definition. The texture is smooth and soft, mimicking the look of a distant painted backdrop in a model set or the extreme defocus of a fast tilt-shift lens. The lighting suggests a {{lighting}} ambience, creating a mood of {{mood}} through color temperature gradients, completely devoid of foreground subjects or sharp focal points. The scene creates a sense of depth through graduated blur, appearing furthest away at the top of the frame.",

The scene is an abstract wash of heavy bokeh circles and diffused light shapes, utilizing {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} to suggest distant lights. In the immediate foreground, a subtle, ornamental optical vignette or 'lens housing' frame surrounds the view, simulating the dark, blurred edges of a camera viewfinder or a physical model case. This dark, blurred framing element feathers softly and transitions into a solid {{background_color}} surface at the outermost edges, isolating the central atmospheric blur within a specific visual context suitable for compositing.
