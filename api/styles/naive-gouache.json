  "description": "Un style d'illustration faux-naïf vibrant imitant la gouache à brosse sèche ou les marqueurs acryliques sur papier texturé, caractérisé par une perspective aplatie et une énergie joyeuse. L'esthétique repose sur des blocs de couleurs complémentaires très saturés—associant typiquement des oranges mandarines à des bleus cobalt—et présente des bords rugueux et organiques où la 'peinture' s'érafle pour révéler le grain du papier en dessous.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant, faux-naïf illustration style mimicking dry-brush gouache or acrylic markers on textured paper, characterized by flattened perspective and joyful energy. The aesthetic relies on high-saturation complementary color blocking—typically pairing tangerine oranges with cobalt blues—and features rough, organic edges where the 'paint' scuffs to reveal the paper tooth underneath.",

  "prompt": "Digital gouache illustration rendered in a whimsical faux-naïf style reminiscent of mid-century children's books and contemporary editorial art. The medium mimics opaque acrylic or gouache paint applied with a dry brush on cold-press watercolor paper, creating a tactile, chalky finish with visible bristle drag and scuffed textures where the white paper tooth shows through the color blocks. The composition features {{subject}} filling the frame in a flattened, planar perspective with no depth of field, emphasizing 2D shape design over realistic volume. Lighting is non-physical and flat, relying entirely on bold color contrast rather than chiaroscuro or cast shadows; there are no gradients, only solid zones of vibrant hue. The color palette is hyper-saturated and playful, dominated by {{primary_color}} in large environmental blocks, accented by {{accent_color}} for key details, creating a lively complementary harmony (e.g., tangerine orange against deep cobalt blue). Linework is sparse, sketchy, and loose—used only for internal details like facial features or patterns—rendered in a dark, uneven ink stroke that feels hand-drawn. Edges are organic and imperfect, showing the 'speed' of the brushstroke. The atmosphere is joyful, bustling, and cozy {{mood}} with a sense of charming imperfection. {{lighting}} is interpreted as bright, uniform ambient illumination that makes colors pop without creating dark pockets. Reinforcement tags: dry brush gouache, scuffed paint texture, naive art, flat perspective, Mary Blair influence, Miroslav Šašek influence, vibrant color blocking, visible paper grain, rough painterly edges, chalky opacity, whimsical character design, hand-painted feel, editorial illustration, playful distortion, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A whimsical, flat-perspective interior or landscape environment rendered in a dry-brush gouache style. The scene is constructed from large, solid blocks of vibrant color, primarily {{primary_color}} with touches of {{accent_color}}, depicting architectural elements like walls, shelves, or hills in a naive, 2D manner. There are no people or main subjects, only the setting itself—perhaps featuring potted plants with sketchy leaves, floating shelving units, or abstract geometric furniture. The texture is chalky and scuffed, showing the white tooth of the paper through the paint in areas of rapid application. Lighting is uniform and shadowless, emphasizing the graphic shapes of the environment. The composition is planar and decorative, feeling like a backdrop for a mid-century children's book.",
