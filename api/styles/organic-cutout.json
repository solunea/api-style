  "description": "Un style graphique minimaliste inspiré des papiers découpés de Matisse, présentant des silhouettes audacieuses et pleines aux proportions organiques exagérées. L'esthétique repose sur un contraste fort entre une figure plate monochrome et un fond uni vibrant, éliminant toute texture et ombrage internes.",
  "description_en": "A minimalist graphic style inspired by Matisse's paper cutouts, featuring bold, solid silhouettes with exaggerated, organic proportions. The aesthetic relies on high contrast between a flat, single-color figure and a vibrant, solid background, eliminating all internal texture and shading.",

  "prompt": "A bold, high-contrast graphic illustration of {{subject}} executed in the style of a primitive paper cutout or a raw ink silhouette. The visual language draws heavy inspiration from Henri Matisse’s later 'cut-outs' and abstract minimalist art, presenting the {{subject}} as a solid, flat shape filled entirely with {{accent_color}}. The figure is set against a uniform, untextured background of {{primary_color}}, creating a stark and vibrating color relationship. The rendering is strictly two-dimensional, rejecting all forms of shading, gradients, depth of field, or internal texture. The {{subject}}'s form is abstracted and stylized with exaggerated proportions—amplified features, elongated limbs, and simplified, blob-like geometry that conveys movement and emotion through pure shape. The edges of the silhouette possess a specific 'scissor-cut' quality: smooth and continuous but with organic irregularities that suggest a handmade process rather than computer-generated perfection. The composition utilizes negative space aggressively, allowing the background color to carve into the subject's form to define posture and gesture. The lighting is non-existent; this is a purely graphic representation where light and shadow are replaced by positive and negative space. The overall mood is playful yet primal, focusing on the essence of the form rather than realistic detail, utilizing a {{mood}} atmosphere through shape language. flat vector graphics, screen print aesthetic, pop art, minimalism, solid color blocking, sharp edges, no outline, high contrast, abstract figuration, primitive modernism, 2D render, artistic abstraction, visual impact, clean lines, bold graphic design, unshaded, matte finish, hard edge painting.",
  "prompt_removebg": "An artistic, high-contrast abstract representation of {{subject}}, executed in the style of a Henri Matisse paper cut-out or primitive modern vector art. The {{subject}} is rendered as a single, cohesive, solid silhouette composed of fluid, exaggerated organic curves and bold geometric simplifications. The proportions should be stylized and expressive—think enlarged hands, fluid limbs, or simplified heads—creating a playful and naive aesthetic similar to Keith Haring or Paul Rand. The figure is filled entirely with a solid, saturated {{primary_color}}, devoid of any internal texture, gradients, shadows, or strokes. This bold shape is set directly against a clean, flat {{background_color}} background, creating a stark and vibrant figure-ground relationship. If distinct elements are needed, use {{accent_color}} for floating abstract shapes or negative space cutouts within the main form. The rendering is strictly 2D flat design, resembling a precise digital vector illustration or a sharp scissor-cut collage. The lighting is non-existent as this is a flat graphical style. The composition focuses entirely on the interplay of the bold positive space of the {{subject}} and the surrounding negative space. No noise, no brushstrokes, no realism. Clean, sharp, and iconic.",
  "background_prompt": "A flat, uniform expanse of {{primary_color}}, completely void of texture, gradients, or shadows. Surrounding the edges are abstract, organic shapes and blob-like forms in {{accent_color}}, resembling paper scraps, torn edges, or Matisse-style seaweed cutouts. These shapes frame a central void, creating a playful interaction between positive and negative space. The aesthetic is strictly 2D, mimicking a clean screen print or vector illustration with hard, crisp edges and high-contrast color blocking, suitable for use as a graphic overlay or a minimalist backdrop.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A minimalist abstract environment featuring bold, fluid organic shapes and floating blobs reminiscent of mid-century modern textile design. The scene is set on a flat {{background_color}} surface, decorated with large, smooth, cutout-style forms in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The composition is rhythmic and balanced, with no central focal point, mimicking a Matisse-inspired wallpaper or a clean vector art pattern. High contrast, zero texture, completely flat lighting.",
