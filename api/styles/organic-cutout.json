  "description": "Un style visuel audacieux canalisant les 'papiers découpés' d'Henri Matisse fusionnés avec l'iconographie expressive de Keith Haring. Il présente des silhouettes solides et très contrastées aux extrémités exagérées et aux courbes biomorphiques fluides, posées sur des champs de couleurs plats et vibrants.",
  "description_en": "A bold visual style channeling the 'papiers découpés' (paper cut-outs) of Henri Matisse merged with the expressive iconography of Keith Haring. It features solid, high-contrast silhouettes with exaggerated extremities and fluid, biomorphic curves set against flat, vibrant color fields.",

  "prompt": "A striking digital art interpretation of the 'papiers découpés' (paper cut-outs) technique, channeling the minimalist energy of Henri Matisse and the bold iconography of Keith Haring, featuring {{subject}} rendered as a solid, uncompromising silhouette in {{accent_color}}. The rendering style is strictly flat 2D vector art with zero shading, gradients, or texture, mimicking the clean slice of scissors through construction paper. The subject is abstracted into fluid, organic shapes with intentionally distorted proportions—specifically massive, exaggerated hands and feet contrasting with a diminished or stylized head, creating a sense of dynamic, primitive rhythm. The silhouette is completely opaque, filled with pure {{accent_color}}, creating a stark, high-contrast figure-ground relationship against a solid, unmodulated {{primary_color}} background. The composition relies heavily on the interplay of positive and negative space, where the gaps between limbs are as important as the limbs themselves, defining the form through absence. There is no simulated lighting, no drop shadows, and no ambient occlusion; the visual language is purely graphic and reductionist. The edges are razor-sharp and anti-aliased, maintaining a crisp, modern vector aesthetic while capturing the soulful, dancing movement of mid-century abstract expressionism. The mood is {{mood}}, conveyed entirely through the gesture and posture of the silhouette rather than facial details. The image is full bleed, extending to all four corners with no borders, frames, or vignettes, focusing entirely on the kinetic energy of the shape. Reinforcement tags: paper cut-out style, biomorphic abstraction, Matisse influence, solid silhouette, flat design, exaggerated anatomy, massive extremities, fluid curves, high contrast, vector illustration, minimalism, pop art influence, distinct negative space, kinetic pose, unshaded, 2D graphic, bold simplicity, organic geometry, artistic reductionism, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A purely abstract background featuring flat, unmodulated fields of color reminiscent of mid-century modern paper cut-outs. The scene is dominated by a solid fill of {{primary_color}}, interrupted only by large, floating organic shapes and biomorphic blobs in {{accent_color}} that drift across the composition like falling leaves or abstract clouds. There is absolutely no texture, shading, or depth; the aesthetic is strictly 2D vector art. The shapes have smooth, undulating curves without sharp angles, creating a sense of rhythmic calm. The lighting is non-existent, relying entirely on the contrast between the color blocks.",
