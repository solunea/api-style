  "prompt": "A premium 3D isometric rendering of {{subject}}, designed with a minimalist and cute aesthetic. The object features a smooth, matte finish resembling soft clay or high-quality silicone, with rounded edges and simplified geometry. The color palette utilizes soft {{primary_color}} as the dominant hue, complemented by subtle {{accent_color}} details to create a gentle contrast. The lighting is incredibly soft and diffuse, simulating global illumination with ambient occlusion, resulting in creamy, non-intrusive shadows and a lack of harsh specular highlights. The rendering is ultra-clean and noise-free, evoking a sense of playfulness and modern UI design. The subject is composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface, ensuring distinct edges for easy isolation, c4d, blender render, unreal engine 5, toy-like, volumetric soft light, 8k resolution, pastel tones, smooth shading, high fidelity.",
