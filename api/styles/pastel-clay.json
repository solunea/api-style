  "description": "Un style de rendu 3D minimaliste caractérisé par des textures mates douces au toucher, un éclairage global doux et une palette de couleurs pastel très claire. Il imite le claymorphisme haut de gamme ou le design de jouets stylisés avec des surfaces lisses, des biseaux arrondis et des ombres d'occlusion ambiante diffuses, entièrement dépourvu de contours durs ou de bruit de surface.",
  "prompt": "High-fidelity 3D claymorphism render executed with a physically based rendering engine like Redshift or Blender Cycles, featuring {{subject}} as the central focus. The visual aesthetic is defined by 'Soft Claymorphism'—a style prioritizing tactile, velvety surfaces and geometric simplicity. The {{subject}} is modeled with exaggerated smoothness, featuring wide, rounded bevels on all edges to catch light softly, eliminating any sharp vertices. The material shader is a sophisticated matte plastic or unglazed ceramic with high roughness, creating a soft-touch appearance that diffuses light evenly across the surface, accented by elements in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. Where transparency is required, materials behave like frosted glass with heavy subsurface scattering, blurring internal details into soft gradients rather than sharp refractions. Lighting is a hallmark of this style: a large, diffused area light source positioned top-left creates a 'softbox' studio effect, resulting in gentle, feather-soft shadows that ground the object without obscuring detail. The shadows exhibit subtle ambient occlusion in crevices, adding depth without high contrast. The color palette is strictly high-key and pastel, utilizing a creamy, warm lighting temperature that harmonizes with the materials. There are no black outlines, no cel-shading, and no grunge textures; the definition comes purely from the interplay of soft light and occlusion. The composition is clean, centered, and isometric or orthographic in perspective, creating a calm, organized look. The atmosphere evokes {{mood}} through the purity of form and softness of light. The image is rendered with a noise-free, ultra-smooth finish, resembling high-end icon design or contemporary 3D illustration found on design platforms.

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist 3D studio environment designed in a soft claymorphism style. The scene consists of a seamless infinite cyclorama wall with a matte, velvety texture in soft pastel tones derived from {{primary_color}}. The lighting is uniform and diffuse, simulating a high-end softbox setup that casts almost no hard shadows, only gentle ambient occlusion in the corners. Scattered in the background are abstract, soft-focus geometric primitives (spheres, rounded cubes, capsules) in {{accent_color}} that float or rest on the floor, providing depth of field and spatial context without clutter. The floor has a subtle satin reflection, blurring the environment slightly. The overall look is clean, serene, and high-key, with no central subject, just the pure atmospheric stage of a 3D design studio.",
