  "description": "Un style d'illustration Néo-Pop audacieux défini par des contours à l'encre noire épais et uniformes et des blocs de couleurs plates et très saturées, rappelant l'art vectoriel moderne et les bandes dessinées classiques. Le langage visuel utilise des 'lignes d'action' rayonnantes et un ombrage 'cel-shading' aux bords nets pour créer une esthétique dynamique proche de l'autocollant, avec une texture subtile de sérigraphie.",
  "description_en": "A bold Neo-Pop illustration style defined by thick, uniform ink outlines and flat, highly saturated color blocking reminiscent of modern vector art and classic comic strips. The visual language uses radiating 'action lines' and hard-edged cel-shading to create a dynamic, sticker-like aesthetic with a subtle screenprint texture.",

  "prompt": "A high-energy Neo-Pop vector illustration of {{subject}}, executed with the precision of modern flat design and the vibrancy of 90s comic art. The rendering style relies on thick, uniform, confident black ink contours that define every shape with geometric clarity, enclosing flat, unmodulated fields of intense, saturated color. The {{subject}} is depicted with exaggerated, expressive features, stylized with hard-edged cel-shading where shadows are solid blocks of darker tone rather than gradients. Surrounding the {{subject}} are characteristic 'action lines'—short, radiating black dashes, motion streaks, and stylized sparks—that convey kinetic energy, shock, or excitement. The color palette is electric and punchy, utilizing {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} in bold contrasts without blending or soft transitions. The surface quality mimics a pristine screen print or risograph, with a very subtle, almost imperceptible halftone dot texture overlaying the flat colors to prevent them from looking purely digital. The composition is strictly 2D, flattening the space into a graphic poster format. The image must occupy the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space, extending fully to all four edges: NO borders, NO frames, NO white margins, NO canvas edges, FULL BLEED to all four corners. The aesthetic is clean, loud, and iconic, merging the simplicity of a logo with the narrative energy of a manga panel, neo-pop, vector art, thick outlines, ligne claire, flat color, cel-shaded, comic book style, pop art, vibrant colors, action lines, sticker art, graphic illustration, screen print aesthetic, bold ink, high contrast, hard edges, cartoon realism, 2D flat, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space",

  "background_prompt": "A dynamic, abstract Neo-Pop background scene devoid of any central subject. The design features a bold, graphic arrangement of radiating 'action lines', geometric bursts, and floating comic-style embellishments like stars or abstract sparks, all drawn with thick black outlines. The space is filled with flat, saturated zones of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, creating a high-energy pattern that mimics a comic book effect background. The lighting is purely graphic, relying on solid color fills and hard-edged shapes. A subtle halftone screen texture overlays the scene to give it a printed tactile quality.
