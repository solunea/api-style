  "description": "Un style d'animation 3D haute fidélité caractérisé par la fusion d'une géométrie stylisée et simplifiée avec un rendu physique hyper-réaliste (PBR). Les caractéristiques visuelles clés incluent une dispersion souterraine distincte sur la peau, des shaders de matériaux tactiles et duveteux comme le feutre ou le velours, et un éclairage global doux qui imite la photographie de studio haut de gamme.",
  "description_en": "A high-fidelity 3D animation style characterized by the fusion of stylized, simplified geometry with hyper-realistic physically based rendering (PBR). Key visual hallmarks include distinct subsurface scattering on skin, tactile 'fuzzy' material shaders like felt or velvet, and soft, global illumination that mimics high-end studio photography.",

  "prompt": "A production-quality 3D CGI character render of {{subject}} executed in a premium feature-film animation style reminiscent of modern Pixar or Dreamworks aesthetics. The rendering engine simulates physically based light transport (Octane or Redshift), creating a tangible, tactile look. The {{subject}} is modeled with stylized, rounded geometry, avoiding sharp angles in favor of smooth, appealing curves. The skin texture is a masterpiece of subsurface scattering (SSS), appearing soft and semi-translucent like wax or high-quality silicone, with reddish light transmission visible through thinner areas like ears or fingertips. The surface finish is matte with a very subtle 'peach fuzz' micro-displacement, eliminating any plastic shine. Clothing and accessories feature {{primary_color}} as the dominant hue, rendered with a heavy, plush fabric shader—think thick cotton, felt, or velvet—with visible microscopic fiber fuzz on the silhouette edges to enhance the sense of softness. {{accent_color}} is used sparingly for eye color, buttons, or small details to create focal contrast. The lighting setup is a sophisticated three-point softbox arrangement: a large, diffuse key light wraps around the form to create soft shadow transitions, while a cool rim light separates the figure from the background. The atmosphere is clean, optimistic, and commercially polished. The composition is a close-up to medium shot, centered and symmetrical, allowing the high-fidelity textures to dominate the frame. The background is a smooth, out-of-focus gradient ramp that complements the {{primary_color}} without competing for attention, utilizing a shallow depth of field to blur any environmental details into creamy bokeh. No canvas texture, no painterly effects—this is pure, clean, high-sample 3D geometry. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, 3D render, cinema4d, octane render, unreal engine 5, subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion, global illumination, stylized pbr, clay render aesthetic, softbox lighting, volumetric haze, high fidelity, character design, tactile textures, velvet shader.",
  "background_prompt": "A soft-focus, abstract 3D environment designed as a studio backdrop for character animation. The scene is devoid of subjects, featuring only a smooth, curved infinity wall or seamless background paper typically used in product photography. The lighting creates a gentle, tonal gradient transitioning from a light, airy hue to a slightly deeper shadow, following the logic of a large softbox light source from the upper left. The color palette utilizes a desaturated, pastel version of {{primary_color}} mixed with creamy whites and soft greys. There are no hard edges or distinct architectural features; instead, the depth is suggested through subtle ambient occlusion in the corners and a heavy gaussian blur (bokeh) effect that mimics a macro lens with a wide aperture. Floating, out-of-focus dust motes or soft light leaks in {{accent_color}} add a microscopic layer of atmosphere without cluttering the clean, minimalist aesthetic.",
