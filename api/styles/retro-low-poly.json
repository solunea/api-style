  "description": "Un style d'illustration vibrant et contrasté imitant la gouache ou l'aquarelle opaque sur papier texturé. Caractérisé par une palette limitée en bichromie ou trichromie, des coups de pinceau expressifs 'mouillé sur sec' et une utilisation importante de l'espace négatif pour définir les formes sans contours distincts.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant, high-contrast illustration style mimicking loose gouache or opaque watercolor on textured paper. Characterized by a limited duotone or tritone palette, expressive wet-on-dry brushwork, and the heavy use of negative space to define forms without distinct outlines.",

  "prompt": "A vivid, expressive gouache painting of {{subject}}, executed in a loose, gestural style reminiscent of Fauvism and contemporary editorial illustration. The artwork occupies the entire canvas, full bleed, edge-to-edge, with absolutely no borders, frames, or margins. The rendering technique mimics opaque watercolor and gouache applied wet-on-dry, characterized by hard-edged shapes, visible bristle marks, and the organic pooling of pigment. The composition relies heavily on the interplay between positive colored shapes and the negative space of the paper, which cuts through the image to define lighting and spatial depth. The color palette is strictly limited and high-contrast, dominated by varying opacities of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, creating a striking duotone or tritone effect. Shadows are not black but are rendered in deep, saturated blocks of {{accent_color}}, while highlights are represented by the raw, unpainted surface. The {{subject}} is constructed from confident, swift brushstrokes that prioritize energy and movement over anatomical precision. Textural details include the roughness of cold-press watercolor paper, the uneven transparency of the paint, and occasional dry-brush scratching. The lighting is flat yet intense, suggesting a bright, direct sun that casts sharp, geometric shadows. The atmosphere is breezy, spontaneous, and artistically raw. The image must extend to every corner of the frame, ensuring the environment and {{subject}} are fully integrated into a seamless, borderless scene. Reinforcement tags: gouache, opaque watercolor, wet-on-dry, expressive brushwork, limited palette, risograph aesthetic, fauvist colors, negative space, hard edges, textured paper, visible grain, spontaneous, gestural, high contrast, artistic sketch, vivid saturation, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",
  "prompt_removebg": "A vivid, expressive gouache painting of {{subject}}, executed in a loose, gestural style reminiscent of Fauvism and contemporary editorial illustration. The rendering technique mimics opaque watercolor and gouache applied wet-on-dry, characterized by hard-edged shapes, visible bristle marks, and the organic pooling of pigment. The image is composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface. The {{subject}} is constructed from confident, swift brushstrokes that prioritize energy and movement over anatomical precision, with limbs, props, or expressive elements intentionally breaking out of the scene frame and overflowing the composition for dynamic impact. The color palette is strictly limited and high-contrast, dominated by varying opacities of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, creating a striking duotone or tritone effect against the {{background_color}} backdrop. Shadows are not black but are rendered in deep, saturated blocks of {{accent_color}}. The edges of the {{subject}} interact organically with the {{background_color}}, showing the ragged texture of the brush bristles rather than a clean vector cut. Textural details include the roughness of cold-press watercolor paper texture within the painted areas, the uneven transparency of the paint, and occasional dry-brush scratching. The lighting is flat yet intense. The atmosphere is breezy, spontaneous, and artistically raw. Reinforcement tags: gouache, opaque watercolor, wet-on-dry, expressive brushwork, limited palette, risograph aesthetic, fauvist colors, negative space, hard edges, textured paper, visible grain, spontaneous, gestural, high contrast, artistic sketch, vivid saturation, subject breaks frame, scene overflow, {{background_color}} background.",
  "background_prompt": "A loose, expressive gouache background scene representing an abstract environment or landscape. The composition is purely atmospheric and environmental, devoid of any central subject, figures, or foreground objects. The style uses a limited palette of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} applied in broad, confident wet-on-dry brushstrokes. Large areas of negative space define the structure of the scene, suggesting light and open air. Abstract organic shapes suggest foliage, architectural planes, or terrain without explicit detail. The texture of cold-press watercolor paper is visible through the washes of paint. The lighting is high-key and flat, creating sharp contrasts between the colored washes and the unpainted areas. The image is full bleed, edge-to-edge, with no borders or frames.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A loose, expressive gouache background scene representing an abstract environment or landscape, rendered against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop. The composition features a decorative, painted foreground frame—such as loose ornamental foliage, abstract geometric brushstrokes, or an ink-wash vignette—composed of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} that frames the empty center where a subject would be. The environmental elements transition organically into the {{background_color}} surface with ragged, dry-brush edges. The style mimics opaque watercolor with visible bristle marks and pigment pooling. The center remains open and spacious, defined by the {{background_color}}, while the surrounding painted elements suggest depth and atmosphere.",
