  "description": "Une esthétique charmante de pixel art 16 bits rappelant les portraits de personnages de RPG classiques des années 90 et les jeux d'aventure PC-98. Ce style présente une palette de couleurs strictement limitée, un crénelage à bords durs sans lissage et un ombrage manuel au niveau du pixel pour créer un aspect numérique rétro distinct et net.",
  "description_en": "A charming 16-bit pixel art aesthetic reminiscent of classic 90s RPG character portraits and PC-98 adventure games. This style features a strictly limited color palette, hard-edged aliasing with no smoothing, and manual pixel-level shading to create a distinct, crisp retro digital look.",

  "prompt": "Authentic 16-bit pixel art aesthetic simulating a retro SNES or PC-98 RPG character portrait, rendering {{subject}} with precise grid-aligned block placement and zero anti-aliasing. The rendering technique strictly adheres to a low-resolution raster grid, utilizing a limited indexed color palette to define form through hard-edged clusters of pixels rather than gradients. The line work consists of dark, single-pixel width contours that break and resume to suggest volume, defining the silhouette against the environment. Lighting is stylized and flat, typical of sprite art, with {{lighting}} casting sharp, blocky shadows and distinct single-pixel specular highlights on glossy surfaces like eyes or metal. The color science employs a nostalgic scheme dominated by {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, using dithering patterns (checkerboard pixel placement) only sparingly for texture transitions. Skin tones and organic surfaces are rendered with flat color blocking, while hair or fur utilizes jagged pixel groups to imply texture. The composition fills the frame completely with the subject and a contextual pixelated background, maintaining a consistent pixel density throughout. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, evoked through the charm of simplified forms and vibrant, digital hues. No vector smoothing, no blur, no high-definition gradients; every element is composed of visible, discrete square pixels.",

  "background_prompt": "A detailed 16-bit pixel art background scene depicting a retro gaming environment without any characters. The scene utilizes a fixed low-resolution grid with visible square pixels and a limited indexed color palette featuring {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. Textures are defined by pixel dithering and repeating tile patterns typical of SNES or Genesis era RPG backgrounds. Lighting is baked into the pixel art with hard-edged shadows and flat shading blocks. The composition creates depth through parallax-ready layering of foreground, midground, and background elements, all rendered with sharp, aliased edges and no smoothing or blur filters.",
