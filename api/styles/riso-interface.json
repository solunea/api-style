  "description": "Un style d'illustration vectorielle surréaliste imitant le reflet d'un miroir brisé, caractérisé par des éclats géométriques angulaires, des couleurs pop-art plates et des bordures blanches distinctes séparant les morceaux fragmentés. L'esthétique combine le design plat moderne avec une texture de grain de film rétro et une approche cubiste disloquée de la composition.",
  "description_en": "A surreal vector illustration style mimicking a shattered mirror reflection, characterized by angular geometric shards, flat pop-art coloring, and distinct white borders separating the fragmented pieces. The aesthetic combines modern flat design with a retro film grain texture and a disjointed, cubist approach to composition.",

  "prompt": "A striking conceptual flat vector illustration of {{subject}} depicted as a reflection in a violently shattered mirror, executed in a bold Pop Art aesthetic. The {{subject}} is fragmented into sharp, irregular geometric shards and angular polygons that are slightly displaced and misaligned, creating a disjointed and surreal cubist distortion while maintaining recognizability. Each shard acts as a flat plane of color with no internal gradient shading, utilizing a limited, high-contrast palette dominated by {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The shards are separated by distinct, thick white or pale blue jagged borders that simulate the physical thickness of broken glass or ceramic, creating a network of negative space fissures. The rendering is strictly 2D flat design but implies depth through the separation of the pieces. A uniform, heavy monochromatic noise or film grain texture overlays the entire image, giving it the tactile quality of a risograph print or vintage editorial illustration. The lighting is non-directional and flat, relying on color contrast rather than shadow to define forms. The image must occupy the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space, full bleed to all four corners, with the solid background color extending to the very edges, NO borders, NO frames, NO white margins, NO canvas edges, the environment must stretch entirely across the canvas. The composition feels suspended in a frozen moment of impact, balancing chaos with geometric precision. High-impact graphic design style, psychological fragmentation, clean vector lines, matte finish, retro-modern synthesis, jagged edges, visual glitch aesthetic, editorial art, poster design, sharp vector cutouts, digital collage.",

  "background_prompt": "An abstract background scene featuring a field of solid, flat {{primary_color}} intersected by jagged, floating geometric shards of {{accent_color}}. The scene evokes a shattered void or a broken digital sky, composed entirely of sharp angular polygons and irregular triangles suspended in space. There is no central subject, only the chaotic rhythm of the fractured shapes and the network of thick white fissure lines connecting them. The style is flat vector art with no gradients, relying on the contrast between the shapes and the negative space. A pervasive, heavy film grain texture coats the entire image, providing a matte, tactile paper feel reminiscent of screen printing or risograph art. The lighting is completely flat and graphic.",
