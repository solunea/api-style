  "description": "Une esthétique d'illustration vibrante et plate imitant l'impression Risograph et le mouvement japonais 'Heta-uma'. Elle se caractérise par des contours tremblants dessinés à la main, des blocs solides de couleurs hyper-saturées sans ombrage, et une texture de bruit uniforme rappelant le papier mat rugueux.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant, flat-style illustration aesthetic mimicking Risograph printing and the Japanese 'Heta-uma' (bad-good) movement. It features shaky, hand-drawn contour lines, solid blocks of hyper-saturated color with zero shading, and a heavy, uniform noise texture resembling rough matte paper.",

  "prompt": "Digital illustration mimicking lo-fi Risograph printing and indie zine aesthetics, featuring {{subject}} rendered with strictly flat, unshaded color blocks and thin, shaky hand-drawn black outlines. The rendering technique creates a 'cut-out' graphic look where forms are defined by distinct color separation rather than light and shadow. The line work is a consistent, thin monoline ink stroke that exhibits intentional wobbly imperfections and lack of line weight variation, suggesting a rotring pen on toothy paper. There is absolutely no shading, no gradients, no volumetric lighting, and no ambient occlusion; the style is purely 2D and planar. The color palette is high-contrast and poster-like, utilizing {{primary_color}} as a dominant field color and {{accent_color}} for key details, creating a triadic or complementary vibration. Apply a heavy, uniform monochromatic noise overlay or 'salt-and-pepper' grain across the entire image to simulate rough matte paper stock, screen print mesh, or high-ISO film grain. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, conveyed through the quirky, imperfect lines and the raw immediacy of the print texture. The composition utilizes negative space to emphasize the graphic silhouette of the subject.",
  "prompt_removebg": "Digital illustration mimicking a 3-color risograph print of {{subject}}, rendered in a raw indie zine aesthetic. The medium is digital ink imitating a 0.5mm felt-tip pen with a slight hand-drawn tremble, creating a continuous, confident, yet imperfect 'ligne claire' contour. The subject is colored with flat, unmodulated fields of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, simulating semi-transparent soy-based inks layered over white paper. There is absolutely no shading, gradient, or volumetric rendering; form is defined strictly by the black ink outline and color blocking. The texture is critical: apply a heavy, uniform high-frequency noise and stipple grain across the entire image to mimic cheap matte recycled paper and ink bleed. Lighting is non-existent; the image relies on graphic clarity and high-contrast separation. The composition is centered and isolated against a solid, flat {{background_color}} backdrop to ensure optimal edge detection. The subject's edges are defined by a crisp, continuous black outline that creates a sharp cut-out silhouette against the {{background_color}} canvas, avoiding any feathered or blurred transparency. Slight color misregistration (trapping errors) is visible where the {{primary_color}} fill meets the ink lines, adding analog authenticity. The overall mood is {{mood}}, captured through the quirky, static posture of the subject.",
  "background_prompt": "A solid, flat field of {{primary_color}} completely devoid of gradients or shadows, heavily textured with uniform monochromatic grain and paper noise. Optionally includes sparse, floating decorative doodles (simple shapes, squiggles, or blobs) in {{accent_color}} drawn with the same thin, shaky black outline style, maintaining a strictly 2D poster-like appearance.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A textured background surface in a flat {{background_color}} hue, heavily treated with risograph grain and paper noise. Scattered floating decorative elements in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}—such as small geometric blobs, stars, or doodle-like squiggles—surround the empty center space. The elements have thin, shaky black outlines and flat color fills with slight print misalignment. The texture suggests a scanned page from a DIY fanzine, with no depth or shadows, purely graphic and ornamental.",
