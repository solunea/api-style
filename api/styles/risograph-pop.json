  "description": "Un style d'illustration inspiré de la risographie, caractérisé par des blocs de couleurs vives et plats, des contours tremblants dessinés à la main et une texture de grain uniforme et prononcée. Il mélange l'esthétique de la 'ligne claire' de la bande dessinée classique avec une sensibilité de fanzine indé contemporain et surréaliste, créant une ambiance détachée par le contraste entre couleurs ludiques et textures lo-fi.",
  "description_en": "A distinctive risograph-inspired illustration style characterized by vibrant, flat color blocks, shaky hand-drawn outlines, and a heavy, uniform grain texture. It blends the 'clear line' aesthetic of classic comics with a contemporary, surreal indie zine sensibility, often creating a cool, detached mood through the contrast of playful colors and gritty, lo-fi paper textures.",

  "prompt": "A high-fidelity risograph-style digital illustration mimicking the tactile imperfections and vibrant flatness of analog indie zine printing. The rendering technique is strictly 2D flat design, utilizing a 'ligne claire' approach with a twist: the outlines are thin, consistent black ink strokes that exhibit a distinct, organic jitter or wobble, suggesting a hand-drawn nib pen on toothy paper rather than a perfect vector curve. The subject, {{subject}}, is depicted in a cool, detached manner, occupying the center of the frame with a static yet engaging pose. The internal coloring consists of bold, unmodulated fields of solid color with absolutely no gradient shading, volumetric highlights, or cast shadows; form is defined entirely by the shaky black contours and the separation of color blocks. The color palette is punchy and saturated, featuring a clash of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} that mimics the limited ink drum options of a Riso machine, creating a vibrant, poster-like impact. A defining characteristic of this style is the heavy, uniform stochastic noise and stipple grain overlay that covers the entire image, softening the digital sharpness and simulating the absorption of soy-based ink into rough, uncoated paper stock. This texture gives the image a sandy, matte finish and a nostalgic, lo-fi atmosphere. The composition is playful and surreal, often integrating floating, whimsical graphic elements or abstract organic shapes around the main figure to fill the negative space without creating a realistic background depth. The lighting is completely flat and ambient, rejecting all photorealistic physics in favor of a graphic, iconographic clarity. The overall mood is {{mood}}, channeling the quirky, 'ugly-cute' aesthetic of modern Japanese pop art and underground comics. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, risograph texture, stipple noise, flat color application, shaky linework, indie art style, zine aesthetic, vibrant palette, matte finish, screen print look, graphic novel illustration, hand-drawn ink, lo-fi grain, pop surrealism, bold contrast, 2D planar composition, unshaded, raw paper texture, contemporary illustration.",

  "background_prompt": "A flat, textured abstract background field typical of risograph printing aesthetics. The scene is a solid, unmodulated expanse of color acting as a graphic void, covered in a heavy, uniform stipple noise and paper grain texture that mimics the tactile quality of rough, uncoated paper stock. Floating sparsely within this flat space are minimalist, surreal doodle elements—small organic blobs, squiggles, or geometric primitives—drawn with thin, shaky black ink lines and filled with flat {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. There is no horizon line, no depth, no perspective, and no light source; the environment is a strictly 2D graphic surface emphasizing the interplay of negative space and the gritty, sandy print quality. The aesthetic is lo-fi, indie zine, and retro-modern, designed to serve as a quirky, poster-like backdrop.",
