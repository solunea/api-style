  "description": "Un style éditorial numérique distinctif imitant l'impression risographique et l'art vectoriel texturé, caractérisé par des formes plates recouvertes d'un grain de bruit uniforme et prononcé. Le langage visuel repose sur un éclairage en projecteur à bords nets pour créer un contraste géométrique marqué entre les zones illuminées et les ombres atténuées.",
  "prompt": "Digital editorial illustration rendered in a textured risograph aesthetic, mimicking the look of screen printing on rough-tooth paper. The composition features {{subject}} integrated into a stylized environment with full-bleed composition, no borders, and no canvas edges. The rendering technique utilizes flat, vector-like color blocking devoid of black contours; instead, details are defined by thin, uniform-width negative space lines (often white or light cream) and distinct color separation. A defining characteristic is the heavy, uniform 'sand' or 'stipple' noise overlay that covers the entire image, giving it a tactile, gritty matte finish. \n\nThe lighting is theatrical and specific: a {{lighting}} source casts a dramatic, hard-edged conical beam or geometric spotlight across the scene. Inside the light beam, colors are high-key, vivid, and warmer; outside the beam, the palette shifts to muted, darker, and cooler tones, creating a sharp visual threshold that cuts through the {{subject}} and environment. The color palette is restricted and sophisticated, utilizing {{primary_color}} for dominant surfaces and {{accent_color}} for focal points within the light, creating a split-complementary harmony. \n\nShadows are not soft or diffused but are rendered as solid, hard shapes with the same stippled texture. Surfaces appear matte, mimicking uncoated paper stock. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, achieved through the cozy yet graphic interplay of light and shadow. Perspective is flattened, often isometric or high-angle, emphasizing shape geometry over realistic depth. The edges of the {{subject}} are crisp but textured by the global grain, avoiding the smoothness of standard digital vector art.",

  "background_prompt": "A stylized interior or surface background rendered in a textured risograph style, completely empty of foreground subjects. The scene depicts a flat, graphic environment—such as a desk surface, a wall, or a minimal room corner—bathed in {{primary_color}} tones with a heavy, uniform noise grain texture. A dramatic, hard-edged beam of light cuts across the empty space, creating a geometric shape of brighter illumination against the darker, muted surroundings. Inside the light shape, the surface texture is high-key and vivid; outside, it is shadowy and cool.
