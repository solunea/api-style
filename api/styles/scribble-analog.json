  "description": "Une esthétique mixte sophistiquée mêlant photographie argentique noir et blanc à fort grain et dessin au trait numérique souple et gestuel. Le style présente une base photo brute au fini mat, surmontée de traits vectoriels blancs sinueux qui tracent et font écho à la forme du sujet, créant un jeu rythmique entre profondeur réaliste et minimalisme graphique plat.",
  "description_en": "A sophisticated mixed-media aesthetic blending high-grain analog black-and-white photography with loose, gestural digital line art. The style features a raw, matte-finished photo base overlaid with sinuous white vector strokes that trace and echo the subject's form, creating a rhythmic interplay between realistic depth and flat graphic minimalism.",

  "prompt": "Mixed-media fusion of vintage analog photography and digital doodle illustration featuring {{subject}} captured in a raw, studio-portrait style. The rendering technique mimics a developed Ilford HP5 Plus black-and-white film photograph, characterized by heavy, organic ISO 1600 grain, low contrast in the shadows, and blown-out creamy highlights. This photographic base is overlaid with distinct, monoline white contour drawings—resembling a white gel pen or vector stroke—that loosely trace the silhouette, hair strands, and clothing folds of the {{subject}}. These white lines do not trace perfectly; they float slightly off-register, creating a 'ghost' or 'echo' effect that adds kinetic energy to the static pose. The lighting is soft, diffuse window light, creating gentle modeling on the face with no harsh shadows, emphasizing a {{mood}} atmosphere. The color palette is strictly monochromatic or heavily desaturated, leaning into sepia, warm greys, and muted tones of {{primary_color}}, while the overlay lines act as a stark, high-contrast {{accent_color}} or pure white graphic element. The background is a textured, wrinkled muslin or linen backdrop that fills the entire frame, visible creases adding to the tactile, imperfect aesthetic. The composition is intimate and centered, with the white lines guiding the eye in fluid loops. Textures range from the softness of skin and hair to the coarse weave of the background fabric and the gritty noise of the film emulsion. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, analog film aesthetic, mixed media, doodle art overlay, fashion editorial style, sketchy white lines, matte finish, soft focus, nostalgic grain, artistic scribbles, raw photography, grayscale with tint, visual rhythm, offset contours, hand-drawn elements, studio backdrop texture, emotive portraiture.",

  "background_prompt": "A textured, wrinkled muslin or linen studio backdrop filling the entire frame, rendered in high-grain black-and-white analog film style. The fabric hangs loosely with visible creases, folds, and gentle undulations that catch soft, diffuse lighting from the left. The texture is gritty and tactile, mimicking ISO 1600 film noise. The color palette is a monochromatic wash of warm greys and muted {{primary_color}} tones, with no foreground subjects. The lighting creates a subtle gradient from light grey to deep shadow in the folds, establishing a raw, unpolished artistic atmosphere suitable for a fashion editorial background.
