  "description": "Ce style capture l'essence de la photographie de produit minimaliste avec un éclairage solaire dur et direct qui crée des ombres géométriques tranchées. L'atmosphère est propre, moderne et réaliste, mettant en valeur le sujet par un jeu de contrastes forts entre la lumière vive et les zones d'ombre profondes.",
  "prompt": "A professional, high-angle studio product photograph of {{subject}}, showcasing a clean and modern minimalist aesthetic. The scene is illuminated by harsh, direct natural sunlight, casting sharp, diagonal geometric shadows across the {{subject}} and the surrounding surface, mimicking light filtering through a window frame or blinds. The composition is uncluttered, focusing entirely on the texture and form of the object. The color grading is bright and airy, utilizing {{primary_color}} as the dominant tone for the subject's highlights, while {{accent_color}} provides subtle contrast in the details or branding elements. The surface texture is smooth, matte, and pristine. The lighting creates a high-contrast look with deep, defined blacks and blown-out whites in the sun-drenched areas, evoking a warm, lazy afternoon atmosphere suitable for high-end mockups, photorealistic, hard lighting, shadow play, 8k, ultra detailed, depth of field, ray tracing, sharp focus, commercial photography.",
  "background_prompt": "A pristine, minimalist surface composed of smooth, matte white or light grey material, bathed in bright, hard natural sunlight. Sharp, distinct diagonal shadows cut across the scene, creating a strong geometric pattern of light and dark, suggestive of a window frame or architectural element out of view. The atmosphere is clean and airy, with subtle ambient reflections of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} bouncing off the neutral ground. The texture is uniform and high-quality, designed to create a sense of depth through the interplay of harsh light and deep shadow without any central subject.",
