  "description": "Un style d'illustration numérique raffiné mêlant l'esthétique vectorielle plate moderne au minimalisme scandinave et à la précision architecturale. Caractérisé par des formes géométriques sans contours, une palette pastel sourde, des ombres diagonales nettes et une texture à grain fin omniprésente qui ajoute chaleur et tactilité à la composition épurée.",
  "description_en": "A refined digital illustration style blending modern flat vector aesthetics with Scandinavian minimalism and architectural precision. Characterized by lineless geometric forms, a muted pastel palette, sharp diagonal shadow casting, and a pervasive fine-grain texture that adds warmth and tactility to the clean composition.",

  "prompt": "A high-fidelity, modern editorial flat vector illustration of {{subject}}, executed with the precision of high-end Scandinavian graphic design. The rendering style is strictly lineless, defining forms through clean, flat color blocks and subtle internal gradients rather than black outlines. The {{subject}} is constructed from simplified geometric volumes—smooth curves, perfect circles, and sharp angles—creating a stylized yet readable silhouette reminiscent of vector art found in premium lifestyle apps or architectural digests. The {{subject}} is rendered against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop, composited on a clean {{background_color}} surface to allow for easy isolation.\n\nThe lighting anatomy is crucial to this style: simulate soft, diffused natural daylight streaming from a specific directional source, casting distinct, sharp-edged diagonal shadows across the {{subject}}. These shadows should be geometric and crisp, contrasting with the soft, airbrushed gradients used for shading within the objects themselves. The color palette is sophisticated, desaturated, and 'hygge', dominated by creamy beiges, warm greys, and soft earth tones, utilizing {{primary_color}} as the dominant hue for the subject's main mass and {{accent_color}} for understated details, all harmonizing with the {{background_color}} field. Avoid neon or hyper-saturated colors; keep the chroma low and the value range narrow but distinct.\n\nApply a uniform, high-frequency monochromatic noise or film grain texture over the {{subject}}. This texture is essential to break the 'digital' plastic look of vectors, giving the artwork the tactile feel of a matte risograph print or high-quality textured paper. The edges of the {{subject}} must be razor-sharp vector cuts, ensuring a perfect silhouette against the {{background_color}} void.",
  "background_prompt": "A minimalist architectural environment or abstract geometric setting rendered in a soft, Scandinavian flat vector style. The scene depicts a clean, organized space—such as a wall, a shelf, or an abstract horizon—composed of flat surfaces and simple shapes. The color palette is muted and calming, utilizing shades of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} mixed with warm whites and oatmeal tones. Sharp, diagonal beams of light cut across the composition, creating distinct geometric shadow shapes on the background elements. The texture is grainy and matte. To create depth for the invisible subject, a subtle decorative foreground element—such as a geometric window frame or a stylized plant silhouette—is placed at the very edges, framing the central void. The entire scene fades or transitions cleanly into a solid {{background_color}} surface at the outer boundaries, ensuring the environment feels contained yet expansive within the compositing space.",
