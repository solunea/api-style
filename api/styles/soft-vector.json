  "description": "Un style d'illustration vectorielle numérique raffiné, caractérisé par un design plat sans contours, une simplification géométrique et une palette pastel apaisante et désaturée. Il utilise des bords nets et propres associés à des rayons de lumière diagonaux doux et semi-transparents pour créer de la profondeur et une atmosphère moderne et calme, rappelant l'art des interfaces technologiques haut de gamme.",
  "description_en": "A refined digital vector illustration style characterized by lineless flat design, geometric simplification, and a soothing, desaturated pastel palette. It utilizes sharp, clean edges paired with soft, semi-transparent diagonal light shafts to create depth and a calm, modern atmosphere reminiscent of high-end tech interface art and 'Flat Design 2.0'.",

  "prompt": "A pristine digital vector illustration rendered in a sophisticated Flat Design 2.0 aesthetic, characterized by razor-sharp geometric precision, mathematical Bézier curves, and a complete absence of raster noise or texture. The rendering technique mimics the clean path-based tools of Adobe Illustrator, where {{subject}} is constructed entirely from solid shapes and color blocking without any black outlines or stroke weight. The visual language borrows from modern tech illustration and 'Corporate Memphis' styles, prioritizing simplified anatomy, smooth contours, and a sense of universal accessibility. The composition is lit by stylized, architectural lighting: distinct diagonal shafts of light (god rays) composed of white geometric shapes at 15-20% opacity cut across the scene, simulating a soft, diffused window source. These light beams interact with the underlying flat colors to create lighter tints, while shadows are rendered as hard-edged, semi-transparent polygons in a multiply blending mode, anchoring objects with precise, angular footprints. The color palette is strictly controlled, desaturated, and high-key, dominated by {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, utilizing analogous harmonies to maintain a calm, 'hygge' atmosphere. There is no texture, grit, or brushwork; every surface appears smooth, matte, and synthetic, similar to high-quality vinyl or vector graphics. The subject fills the frame completely, integrated into a minimal, orderly environment that reflects a mood of {{mood}} and digital wellness. The spatial dynamics are stable and planar, with depth implied through the layering of foreground, midground, and background shapes rather than perspective convergence. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, vector art, flat illustration, lineless art, geometric minimalism, pastel tones, soft lighting, adobe illustrator style, clean UI graphics, architectural geometry, serene atmosphere, matte finish, hard-edge shadows, lifestyle illustration, modern aesthetic, crisp silhouette, untextured surfaces, digital smoothness, behance style, dribbble aesthetic, soft gradients, shape-based rendering.",
  "background_prompt": "A serene, minimalist architectural interior or landscape setting rendered in a clean flat vector style, devoid of any human presence or main subject. The scene focuses on geometric structures—such as sleek cabinetry, shelving units, simple furniture forms, or distant rolling hills—composed of solid shapes in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. Diagonal shafts of semi-transparent light cut across the frame, casting sharp, angular shadows that define the spatial depth and layering. The environment is orderly and pristine, with smooth, matte surfaces and a distinct lack of texture, grain, or noise. The perspective is flattened yet implies depth through the stacking of foreground and background planes. The lighting suggests a quiet morning, with a soft, diffused glow illuminating the {{primary_color}} surfaces. Full bleed, no border, no frame.",
