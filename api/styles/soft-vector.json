  "description": "Une esthétique de design plat sophistiquée caractérisée par une géométrie vectorielle sans contours, des palettes pastel douces et un éclairage diagonal à bords nets distinctif. Ce style évoque le calme moderne grâce à des formes simplifiées, une précision architecturale et une finition mate sans texture, typique des illustrations éditoriales technologiques haut de gamme.",
  "description_en": "A sophisticated flat design aesthetic characterized by lineless vector geometry, soft pastel palettes, and distinct hard-edged diagonal lighting. This style evokes modern calm through simplified forms, architectural precision, and a matte, texture-free finish typical of high-end tech editorial illustrations.",

  "prompt": "High-fidelity digital vector illustration rendered in a sophisticated, lineless flat design style reminiscent of modern lifestyle editorial art and high-end tech branding. The visual language is constructed from clean, mathematically precise Bézier curves with absolutely no raster noise, grain, or brush texture. The scene features {{subject}} integrated seamlessly into a minimalist environment, filling the frame completely with a full-bleed composition. The rendering technique relies on solid shapes and gradient-free color blocking to define form, eschewing black outlines entirely in favor of contrast-based separation. Lighting is the defining stylistic element: a soft, directional light source (resembling natural window light) casts distinct, hard-edged diagonal geometric shadows across the scene, creating depth through 'multiply-blend' style darkened overlays rather than realistic shading. These shadows cut across surfaces with architectural precision, adding a layer of visual rhythm to the otherwise flat composition. The color palette is strictly curated, utilizing soft, muted pastels and earthy tones, anchored by {{primary_color}} as the dominant environmental hue and {{accent_color}} for focal points and details. The value range is high-key and low-contrast, maintaining a serene, airy atmosphere throughout. Textures are implied through simplified vector patterns (such as repeating geometric shapes for fabrics or foliage) rather than bitmap detail. The {{subject}} is stylized with elegant, simplified anatomy and minimal facial features, prioritizing gesture and silhouette over hyper-realism. The overall mood is {{mood}}, conveyed through the orderly arrangement of elements and the tranquil, static lighting. {{lighting}} enhances the scene with subtle tonal shifts on flat surfaces. Reinforcement tags: flat vector art, lineless illustration, corporate memphis evolution, architectural geometry, hard shadow overlays, pastel color theory, vector minimal, clean shapes, adobe illustrator style, matte finish, lifestyle aesthetic, simplified forms, precise geometry, soft daylight, editorial design, behance feature, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, sharp vector edges.",
  "background_prompt": "A pristine, minimalist architectural interior rendered in a flat vector illustration style, completely devoid of characters or subjects. The scene focuses on clean geometric planes, furniture, or environmental elements constructed from solid color blocks and lineless shapes. The composition is defined by sharp, hard-edged diagonal shadows cast by an unseen window light source, cutting across walls and surfaces to create depth and visual interest. The palette is dominated by muted shades of {{primary_color}} with subtle touches of {{accent_color}} in the decor or foliage. Surfaces are smooth and matte, with no texture or grain. The perspective is flattened but retains spatial logic through the layering of foreground and background elements. The atmosphere is organized, airy, and serene, embodying a modern 'hygge' or orderly lifestyle aesthetic. Full bleed, no frames, no borders.",
