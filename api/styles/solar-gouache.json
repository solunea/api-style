  "description": "Un style d'illustration vibrant et très contrasté, canalisant l'esthétique City Pop japonaise des années 80 et la précision d'Eizin Suzuki. Il se caractérise par un rendu plat et opaque à la gouache, des ombres portées nettes et tranchantes, des couleurs méditerranéennes hyper-saturées et une composition graphique où la lumière et l'ombre forment des formes géométriques distinctes.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant, high-contrast illustration style channeling 80s Japanese City Pop aesthetics and the precision of Eizin Suzuki. It features flat, opaque gouache rendering with razor-sharp hard shadows, hyper-saturated Mediterranean colors, and a graphic composition where light and shadow form distinct geometric shapes.",

  "prompt": "Digital gouache illustration in the distinct style of 80s Japanese City Pop and Eizin Suzuki, rendered with vector-like precision and flat opaque color blocking. The scene depicts {{subject}} integrated into a sun-drenched, high-contrast environment. The rendering technique mimics hot-press illustration board with zero texture grain—surfaces are smooth, matte, and uniform. There are no visible brushstrokes; instead, shapes are defined by razor-sharp edges and distinct color separation, creating a cut-paper aesthetic. \n\nThe lighting is the defining feature: harsh, direct overhead noon sunlight that casts extremely distinct, hard-edged shadows. These shadows are not black but a cool, deep azure or slate grey, creating a vibrant complementary contrast against the warm, sunlit areas. Shadows are treated as solid geometric shapes projected onto surfaces, with no soft penumbra or diffusion. \n\nThe color palette is high-key and hyper-saturated, dominated by {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, set against blindingly bright whites and deep, unvarying cobalt blue skies. There is no atmospheric haze; distant objects are as sharp and saturated as foreground elements, flattening the depth into a graphic poster-like composition. \n\nMateriality feels like polished acrylic or screen printing—clean, synthetic, and idyllic. {{mood}} atmosphere evokes an endless summer, nostalgic warmth, and a serene, time-stopped stillness. The composition is full bleed, extending to all four edges with no borders, emphasizing the interplay of positive and negative space through shadow projection. \n\nReinforcement tags: Eizin Suzuki style, Hiroshi Nagai influence, flat shading, hard edge painting, mediterranean aesthetic, solarized colors, opaque gouache, vector finish, high chroma, sharp shadows, summer vibes, architectural geometry, clear blue sky, pop art minimalism, cel-shaded lighting, graphic illustration, clean lines, vibrant saturation, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A pristine, sun-drenched architectural or landscape backdrop in the style of Eizin Suzuki and 80s City Pop illustration. The scene features stark white geometric walls, terracotta details, or lush manicured foliage, set against a vast, deep cobalt blue sky.
