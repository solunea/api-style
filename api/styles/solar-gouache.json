  "description": "Un style d'illustration vibrant et très contrasté, ancré dans l'art de la City Pop japonaise des années 1980 et les œuvres d'Hiroshi Nagai. Il se caractérise par des bords nets comme des rasoirs, des aplats de couleurs opaques et saturées, et un éclairage zénithal dur qui projette des ombres géométriques aux tons froids sur des surfaces inondées de soleil.",
  "description_en": "A vibrant, high-contrast illustration style rooted in 1980s Japanese City Pop art and the works of Hiroshi Nagai. It features razor-sharp hard edges, flat fields of saturated opaque color, and harsh noon lighting that casts distinctive, geometric cool-toned shadows against stark, sun-drenched surfaces.",

  "prompt": "A masterful digital illustration executed in the iconic visual style of 1980s Japanese City Pop and the aesthetic lineage of Hiroshi Nagai and Eizin Suzuki. The artwork depicts {{subject}} using a flat, opaque gouache painting technique that mimics the precision of vector art. The rendering is defined by razor-sharp, hard edges with absolutely no visible outlines or contour strokes; forms are distinguished solely by the high-contrast juxtaposition of saturated color fields. The lighting is engineered to simulate blindingly bright, direct noon sunlight, creating crisp, unfeathered cast shadows that are rendered in specific cool tones (slate blue or violet-grey) to contrast against the warmth of the sun-lit areas. The color palette is hyper-vibrant and strictly controlled, utilizing {{primary_color}} as the dominant anchor and {{accent_color}} for popping details, all set against a backdrop of deep, gradient-free azure skies or stark architectural whites. Textures are completely smoothed out to a matte finish, devoid of noise, grain, or brushwork, resembling a pristine lithographic screen print. The composition emphasizes geometric simplicity and flat planar depth. The atmosphere evokes a nostalgic, endless summer feeling, imbued with a sense of {{mood}}. The image must occupy the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space, ensuring the environment stretches entirely across the canvas. Full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas edges, occupying entire space, hiroshi nagai style, city pop aesthetic, flat shading, hard edge painting, vector style, gouache opaque, high saturation, summer noon lighting, sharp shadows, clear blue sky, minimal detail, pop art influence, architectural geometry, clean lines, matte finish, 80s retro, vibrant luminosity, graphic design, poster art.",

  "background_prompt": "A pristine, sun-drenched environmental scene rendered in the flat, high-contrast style of 80s City Pop illustration. The view focuses on architectural or natural planes defined by stark white surfaces and deep, saturated azure skies. Harsh noon sunlight casts sharp, geometric shadows in cool grey-blue tones across the ground and walls. The scene features minimalist geometric forms, perhaps a suggestion of a tiled patio, a sleek wall, or a distant horizon line, utilizing {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} to punctuate the space. There is no central subject, only the serene, empty stage of an endless summer day, rendered with matte, opaque gouache textures and razor-sharp edges.",
