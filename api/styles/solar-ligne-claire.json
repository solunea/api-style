  "description": "Une esthétique sophistiquée de 'Ligne Claire' rappelant les romans graphiques de science-fiction européens classiques des années 1970 et 80. Ce style associe des contours à l'encre noire précis et uniformes à une palette vibrante et surréaliste de couleurs gouachées plates – contrastant souvent des sols chauds saumon ou terre cuite avec des ciels azur frais – et utilise des ombres aux bords nets et aux tons froids pour définir le volume sans dégradés.",
  "description_en": "A sophisticated 'Ligne Claire' (clear line) aesthetic reminiscent of classic European sci-fi graphic novels from the 1970s and 80s. This style combines precise, uniform black ink contours with a vibrant, surreal palette of flat gouache colors—often contrasting warm salmon or terracotta grounds with cool azure skies—and uses hard-edged, cool-toned shadows to define volume without gradients.",

  "prompt": "Masterpiece graphic novel illustration in the style of European sci-fi 'Ligne Claire' (Clear Line), showcasing {{subject}}. The artwork is executed with surgical precision using thin, uniform black ink outlines that define every structural edge with constant weight, devoid of hatching or cross-hatching for shading. The rendering mimics flat gouache or cel-shaded digital coloring, avoiding soft airbrushing in favor of distinct, hard-edged blocks of color. The lighting creates sharp, geometric shadow shapes that are colored in cool purples, deep blues, or teals rather than pure black, contrasting against a high-key environment. The color palette is surreal and pastel-rich, dominated by {{primary_color}} tones in the foreground elements and striking {{accent_color}} highlights, set against a backdrop of vast, atmospheric depth. Textures are smooth and matte, with occasional stippling used only to suggest grit on weathered surfaces. The composition emphasizes immense scale and clarity, with a deep depth of field where even distant elements retain their crisp outlines. The image must be FULL BLEED, occupying the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space, stretching edge-to-edge with NO borders, NO white margins, NO frames, and NO canvas edges visible. The atmosphere is contemplative, silent, and vast, evoking a 'used future' aesthetic where technology meets organic landscapes. High-resolution, crisp vector-like finish, 8k definition.",

  "background_prompt": "A vast, silent sci-fi landscape rendered in a precise 'Ligne Claire' graphic novel style. The scene depicts an expansive terrain of rolling dunes, rocky plateaus, or ancient technological ruins, colored in shades of {{primary_color}} and weathered earth tones. The sky is a smooth, flat gradient, perhaps featuring a massive, pale celestial body, transitioning from pale haze to deep zenith. Hard-edged, cool-toned shadows stretch across the ground, cast by a bright, directional light source. The environment is detailed with fine, uniform ink lines and flat matte colors, evoking a sense of infinite scale and quiet desolation.
