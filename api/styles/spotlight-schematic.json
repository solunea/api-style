The drawing style is technical yet whimsical, set upon a textured, off-white paper surface with visible grain and speckles. A dramatic, semi-transparent conical spotlight beam in {{accent_color}} shines down from above, illuminating a specific circular section of the {{subject}}. Inside this pool of light, the details are filled with solid flat {{accent_color}} tones, creating a focal point, while elements outside the beam remain as clean, unfilled skeletal outlines. The composition is minimalist with ample negative space, composited on a clean {{background_color}} background to ensure sharp edge definition.",
