  "prompt": "Isometric technical illustration rendered as fine-point ink liner drawing on coarse, speckled recycled paper, featuring {{subject}} as the central focal point in a high-angle orthographic projection. The rendering technique mimics architectural drafting with a consistent, non-tapering hairline stroke weight in {{primary_color}} ink, devoid of cross-hatching or shading gradients. The composition is defined by a stark, dramatic lighting mechanic: a single overhead source casts a sharp, geometric cone of {{accent_color}} illumination directly onto the {{subject}}. Inside this cone of light, the surfaces are filled with a translucent, flat wash of {{accent_color}} that multiplies against the paper grain, highlighting the details of the {{subject}}. Outside the cone, the scene remains strictly monochromatic {{primary_color}} linework on the beige paper background, creating a high-contrast 'lit vs unlit' duality. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, emphasized by the isolation of the subject in the vast negative space of the paper. The texture is tactile and gritty, with visible paper fibers and random speckling interfering slightly with the ink lines. The perspective is strictly isometric, preserving parallel lines without vanishing points. The {{subject}} is depicted with obsessive, diagrammatic detail, capturing every button, screw, and edge with clinical precision. No border, full bleed, edge-to-edge paper texture, editorial illustration style, ligne claire influence, minimalist color palette, technical schematic aesthetic, vector-like clarity with analog texture, visual storytelling through selective lighting.",
