  "description": "Un style d'illustration technique distinctif mettant en vedette des dessins précis à l'encre fine sur du papier beige texturé. L'élément déterminant est un cône de lumière géométrique qui colore sélectivement le point focal, contrastant avec les contours monochromes de l'environnement environnant.",
  "prompt": "A highly detailed technical line art illustration of {{subject}} presented as a precise architectural sketch or isometric diagram. The artwork is rendered using fine, consistent ink lines in {{primary_color}} on a heavy, textured beige paper background. A dramatic, semi-transparent geometric cone of light in {{accent_color}} shines down from above, creating a 'spotlight effect' that illuminates the central subject. Inside the beam of light, the forms are slightly filled with warm, flat tones of {{accent_color}}, while everything outside the cone remains as hollow, skeletal outlines in {{primary_color}}. The paper texture is prominent, featuring visible grain, fibers, imperfections, and speckles resembling recycled cardstock or vintage vellum. The composition utilizes negative space and clean geometry to create a mood of focused isolation and schematic clarity. The rendering style balances mechanical precision with hand-drawn warmth, utilizing flat perspective and sharp vector-like strokes. Reinforcement tags: isometric view, technical drawing, blueprint aesthetic, grainy paper texture, selective coloring, volumetric lighting, hard edges, minimal shading, schematic, drafting style, clean lines, high contrast, 2D flat illustration.",

  "prompt_removebg": "A sophisticated isometric line art illustration of {{subject}} rendered in a technical drafting style, set against a highly textured {{background_color}} paper background. The artwork uses fine, consistent ink lines in {{primary_color}} to define the shapes with precision and clarity, mimicking the look of a architectural sketch or engineering diagram. The defining visual feature is a dramatic, hard-edged cone of light projecting from above in {{accent_color}}. This beam of light creates a 'spotlight effect': everything within the geometric light cone is washed in a flat, translucent {{accent_color}} fill, highlighting the {{subject}}, while everything outside the beam remains as transparent, negative-space outlines showing the {{background_color}} texture underneath. The composition relies on the interplay between the detailed {{primary_color}} wireframe lines and the bold block of {{accent_color}} light. There is no shading or gradient shading, only the flat interaction of line, paper texture, and the projected light shape. Visible paper grain, speckles, and slight imperfections add a tactile, vintage stationery feel. The aesthetic is clean, organized, yet artistically hand-drawn. Reinforcement tags: isometric perspective, fine liner, technical illustration, blueprint aesthetic, high contrast, clean lines, vector style, paper texture overlay, minimalist, geometric lighting, 2D flat design, crisp details.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "A wide shot of a textured {{background_color}} paper surface featuring scattered environmental details and debris sketched in fine {{primary_color}} outlines. Faint architectural grid lines or perspective guides fade into the background. A dramatic, geometric beam of {{accent_color}} light cuts through the empty space, illuminating a patch of the floor or surface, creating a focal point without a main subject. The texture of the paper is prominent with visible grain and fibers."
