  "description": "Une recréation numérique sophistiquée de la gravure sur acier et de l'impression en taille-douce du XIXe siècle, utilisant des hachures précises pour définir le volume sans dégradés. L'esthétique imite les illustrations scientifiques d'époque ou l'art des billets de banque, caractérisée par un travail à l'encre monochrome profond sur un substrat contrasté.",
  "description_en": "A sophisticated digital recreation of 19th-century steel engraving and intaglio printing, utilizing precise hatching and cross-hatching to define volume without gradients. The aesthetic mimics vintage scientific illustrations or banknote art, characterized by deep monochromatic ink work against a clean, contrasting substrate.",

  "prompt": "High-fidelity steel engraving and copperplate etching simulation, rendered with the precision of a 19th-century scientific illustration or banknote vignette. The visual language relies entirely on binary line work—there are absolutely no soft gradients, washes, or greyscale shading; all value and volume are communicated exclusively through the density, frequency, and thickness of ink strokes. The {{subject}} is depicted with ornithological and botanical exactitude, filling the frame in a dynamic composition that bleeds to the edges. The rendering technique employs a sophisticated mix of contour-following hatching to describe the roundness of organic forms, dense cross-hatching for deep shadow areas, and delicate stippling or short dashed strokes to convey texture such as feathers, fur, or bark. The line quality is crisp and confident, mimicking the physical bite of a burin into a metal plate, with lines that swell and taper elegantly. Lighting is conceptual and high-contrast {{lighting}}, defined by the absence of ink in highlight areas (paper white) and the heavy accumulation of {{primary_color}} ink in the shadows, creating a dramatic chiaroscuro effect. The color palette is strictly duotone: deep, saturated {{primary_color}} ink pressed onto a {{accent_color}} paper texture, which possesses a subtle grain visible between the lines. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, evoking the intellectual rigor of a Victorian encyclopedia plate or the timeless value of currency design. Every element, from the main subject to the smallest detail, is etched with microscopic clarity, avoiding any blurring or depth-of-field effects to maintain the flat, graphic integrity of the print medium. Reinforcement tags: steel engraving, copperplate etching, intaglio print, banknote style, cross-hatching, linear shading, woodcut influence, scientific illustration, botanical art, vector precision, monochromatic ink, high contrast, guilloche patterns, linear texture, vintage aesthetic, ink on paper, detailed line work, form-following strokes, engraving burin, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

  "background_prompt": "A highly detailed engraved landscape scene devoid of any central subject, executed in the style of 19th-century steel engraving or banknote backdrops. The environment features rolling hills, dense foliage, or architectural elements rendered entirely through precise {{primary_color}} hatching and cross-hatching on a {{accent_color}} paper texture. The sky is depicted with widely spaced, horizontal parallel lines to suggest atmosphere without gradients. Shadows are formed by dense mesh-work of ink lines, while highlights rely on the bare {{accent_color}} substrate. The scene is static, serene, and serves as a textural backdrop with uniform focus and graphic clarity, mimicking the background layer of a vintage bond certificate or botanical plate.",
