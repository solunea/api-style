  "description": "Un style d'illustration vectorielle moderne et minimaliste, mêlant les proportions exagérées du Corporate Memphis à des contours monolignes fins et précis. Caractérisé par des aplats de couleurs, des formes géométriques flottantes et des éléments d'interface abstraits, il crée une esthétique technologique épurée typique des startups. Le langage visuel repose sur un trait noir à fort contraste sur un espace négatif étendu, sans ombrage ni dégradé.",
  "description_en": "A modern, minimalist vector illustration style blending the exaggerated proportions of Corporate Memphis with precise, thin monoline outlines. Characterized by flat spot colors, floating geometric primitives (circles, plus signs), and abstract UI elements, creating a clean, tech-forward aesthetic often used in startup branding. The visual language relies on high-contrast black line work against expansive negative space, with no shading or gradients.",

  "prompt": "A pristine, high-fidelity vector illustration executed in a sophisticated Linear Memphis and modern flat design aesthetic. The artwork depicts {{subject}} rendered with consistent, thin, uniform-width black ink outlines (monoline) that define every major form with surgical precision. The drawing style is strictly 2D, eschewing all gradients, shadows, drop shadows, or ambient occlusion in favor of absolute flatness and clarity. The {{subject}} is stylized with slightly exaggerated, fluid proportions typical of contemporary tech branding, integrated seamlessly into a dynamic composition of floating abstract elements. \n\nColor application is deliberate and minimal: specific areas within the black contours are filled with flat, unmodulated swatches of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, while other segments remain transparent or white to create a sense of lightness and breathability. The environment is an immersive, edge-to-edge abstract workspace populated by floating UI panels, skewed rectangles, small decorative plus signs, hollow circles, and squiggles that extend to all four corners of the canvas. \n\nThe image must occupy the absolute ENTIRE dedicated space with full-bleed coverage; there are no borders, no white margins, and no framing constraints. The background is a subtle, cohesive field of minimal geometric patterns and scattered data artifacts that ensures the composition feels expansive and limitless. The line work is vector-perfect, resembling an SVG export from Adobe Illustrator, with crisp Bezier curves and sharp terminations. The overall mood is {{mood}}, conveyed through the energetic arrangement of the floating shapes and the confident, clean posture of the {{subject}}. The lighting is non-existent; the forms are defined purely by line and local color contrast.",

  "background_prompt": "A minimalist abstract environment designed in a linear vector style, featuring a scattered arrangement of floating geometric primitives and tech-inspired shapes. The scene includes skewed floating rectangles representing blank UI screens, small hollow circles, decorative plus signs, and squiggly data lines. The elements are drawn with thin, uniform black outlines and sparse spot fills of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. There is no central subject. The composition is open and airy, suggesting a digital workspace or a concept of organization and flow. The background texture is smooth and flat, with the floating elements distributed evenly to create a sense of balance and modern efficiency without clutter.",
