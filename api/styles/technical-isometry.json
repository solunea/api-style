  "description": "Un style d'illustration vectorielle isométrique précis imitant les manuels techniques de haute qualité et les vues éclatées. Il présente des contours noirs nets et uniformes sur fond blanc, avec une coloration ponctuelle fonctionnelle dans des teintes saturées pour mettre en évidence les composants clés, utilisant des lignes pointillées et des flèches pour indiquer le processus et le flux.",
  "description_en": "A precise, isometric vector illustration style mimicking high-quality technical manuals and exploded-view diagrams. It features clean, uniform black outlines on white, with functional spot-coloring in saturated hues to highlight key components, utilizing dashed lines and arrows to indicate process and flow.",

  "prompt": "A precise, high-definition technical vector illustration of {{subject}} rendered in the style of a modern instructional manual or exploded-view diagram. The rendering technique is pure digital vector line art with uniform, mono-weight black contours resembling the Ligne Claire aesthetic, completely devoid of pixel noise or painterly brushstrokes. The {{subject}} is presented in a sharp isometric projection, potentially deconstructed into constituent parts or layers to reveal internal geometry and functional mechanics. Utilize an 'exploded view' composition where components float slightly apart, connected by crisp dashed guide lines, directional arrows, and assembly path indicators that suggest movement or construction flow. The color palette is strictly high-contrast and functional: the majority of the form is rendered in white with stark black outlines, punctuated by bold, flat, unmodulated applications of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} to highlight specific functional zones, buttons, liquid reservoirs, or interactive elements. There is no ambient lighting, no cast shadows, no gradients, and no surface texture; depth is conveyed solely through overlapping forms, occlusion, and minimal, clean parallel hatching on curved surfaces to indicate cylindrical volume. The image must occupy the entire canvas edge-to-edge, full bleed, with the diagrammatic elements, floating parts, and guide lines stretching to all four corners, creating a dense, informative visual field without any borders, frames, white margins, or canvas edges. The aesthetic is clinical, organized, and hyper-legible, evoking the clarity of patent drawings, IKEA assembly guides, or industrial design schematics. Use {{mood}} to subtly influence the complexity of the mechanical arrangement. \n\nReinforcement tags: isometric projection, technical illustration, vector art, exploded view, schematic, instructional manual style, line art, mono-weight lines, spot color, flat shading, diagrammatic, patent drawing, industrial design, clean lines, hard edges, dashed lines, directional arrows, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, occupying entire space, high contrast, information design.",
