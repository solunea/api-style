  "description": "Un style d'illustration technique précis imitant les manuels de montage, caractérisé par une projection isométrique et des vues 'éclatées' déconstruites. Il présente des contours vectoriels noirs uniformes, des remplissages de couleurs fonctionnels plats et des lignes directionnelles en pointillés pour indiquer les relations mécaniques et le flux d'assemblage.",

  "prompt": "Digital vector technical illustration in a pristine isometric projection, executed with the clarity of a high-end engineering manual or assembly guide. The image depicts {{subject}} as a complex, deconstructed mechanical assembly in a dramatic exploded view. The components of the {{subject}} are separated along the isometric axes, hovering in space to reveal internal architecture, hidden layers, and constituent parts. Dashed black indicator lines and directional arrows trace the path of assembly, connecting the floating elements back to their origin points. \n\nThe rendering technique relies entirely on crisp, uniform-weight black ink outlines with absolutely no variation in thickness, mimicking a plotter or vector graphic. There is no shading, ambient occlusion, or realistic texture; the forms are defined solely by line and flat color fills. The palette is strictly functional and high-contrast: the main body of the {{subject}} is rendered in stark white and technical light greys, while key functional modules are highlighted in vibrant, flat {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} to draw the eye and denote interactivity. \n\nThe atmosphere is clinical, informative, and logically ordered. The composition is dense and fills the visual field completely, with the technical diagram extending to the very edges of the canvas. The background is a seamless, sterile white or faint grid that supports the diagrammatic language without distraction. Every edge is razor-sharp, with geometric perfection in curves and corners. The aesthetic is strictly flat design, prioritizing legibility and structural logic over atmospheric depth.\n\nisometric, exploded view, technical drawing, schematic, diagram, vector art, assembly guide, instructional design, linear, flat design, engineering, deconstructed, mechanical, precision, blueprint, line art, technical manual, educational, graphic design, layout, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space",

  "background_prompt": "A purely diagrammatic background environment featuring a precise, faint isometric grid extending infinitely across the canvas. The scene includes abstract floating technical indicators, dashed directional lines, and geometric measurement markers arranged in a logical, asymmetrical layout. The aesthetic is clinical and clean, utilizing minimal black vector lines and flat {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} geometric accents to suggest a digital workspace, drafting table, or engineering blueprint surface. There is no central subject, only the structural drafting context and spatial guides typical of technical documentation.",
