  "description": "Ce style combine des formes géométriques plates et audacieuses avec l'esthétique granuleuse et texturée de l'impression risographique et de l'illustration au pinceau sec. Il présente des blocs de couleurs très contrastés, des bords rugueux et déchiquetés, ainsi qu'un mélange de noirs profonds et de tons primaires vibrants pour créer un look contemporain et abstrait.",
  "description_en": "This style combines bold, flat geometric shapes with the grainy, textured aesthetic of risograph printing and dry-brush illustration. It features high-contrast color blocking, rough jagged edges, and a mix of solid blacks with vibrant primary tones to create a contemporary, abstract look.",

  "prompt": "A striking, highly stylized contemporary illustration of {{subject}} rendered in a bold, abstract flat-art style reminiscent of risograph printing and mixed-media collage. The composition is constructed from large, confident geometric blocks of color with distinct, rough-hewn edges that mimic dry brushstrokes, chalk marks, or torn paper. The rendering avoids smooth gradients entirely, relying instead on sharp, hard-edged transitions between color planes to define form and volume. The palette is dominated by {{primary_color}} for the main structural shapes and {{accent_color}} for vibrant highlights and details, all anchored by deep, solid ink blacks for shadows and outlines. The surface texture is crucial: apply a heavy grain, stippling noise, and 'misaligned print' effects typical of screen printing. Incorporate patterned mark-making within the color blocks, such as white dashed lines or scattered spray-paint speckles, to add tactile depth. The background is a flat, warm cream or off-white paper texture to enhance the contrast. The overall mood is artistic, expressive, and graphically punchy, blending elements of street art, mid-century modern graphic design, and textured vector illustration.",
  "background_prompt": "An abstract graphic composition featuring large, flat geometric shapes and rough, dry-brush textures on a cream-colored paper background. Bold swaths of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} intersect with jagged, chalk-like edges. The design includes grainy risograph textures, scattered stipple patterns, and loose, expressive brush marks that create a frame around a central negative space. The aesthetic is minimal, textured, and resembles a vintage screen-printed poster.",

  "prompt_removebg": "A striking, highly stylized artistic illustration of {{subject}} rendered in a bold, mixed-media aesthetic reminiscent of textured gouache and acrylic markers. The artwork utilizes a distinct 'color blocking' technique where forms are defined by flat, jagged shapes rather than smooth gradients. The palette is dominated by distinct areas of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, creating a high-contrast visual impact set against a clean {{background_color}} background. The texture is crucial: visible dry-brush strokes, rough edges, and stippled noise patterns (particularly in textured areas like hair or fabric) give the image a tactile, hand-crafted feel. Black ink-like lines are thick, uneven, and expressive, occasionally breaking into wavy, zigzag, or scribbled patterns to define shadows and contours. The composition embraces negative space, allowing the {{background_color}} canvas to interact with the subject, sometimes cutting into the form to create highlights. Lighting is implied through sharp color changes rather than soft shadows, creating a posterized, graphic novel effect. The rendering style avoids photorealism entirely, favoring a flat, dimensional collage look with a grainy, matte finish. High contrast, sharp focus, artistic abstraction, screen print aesthetic, visible bristle marks, editorial illustration style, modern art, expressive strokes.",
  "background_prompt_removebg": "An abstract artistic background composition featuring rough, dry-brush textures and bold geometric fragments in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The scene includes expressive scribbles, stippled noise patterns, and jagged blocks of color set against a clean {{background_color}} surface. The aesthetic mimics a torn paper collage or a painted surface with peeling layers, emphasizing tactile grunge, broad strokes, and artistic imperfection without any central subject, creating a decorative frame of raw artistic expression."
