  "description": "Ce style combine des formes géométriques plates et audacieuses avec l'esthétique granuleuse et texturée de l'impression risographique et de l'illustration au pinceau sec. Il présente des blocs de couleurs très contrastés, des bords rugueux et déchiquetés, ainsi qu'un mélange de noirs profonds et de tons primaires vibrants pour créer un look contemporain et abstrait.",
  "description_en": "This style combines bold, flat geometric shapes with the grainy, textured aesthetic of risograph printing and dry-brush illustration. It features high-contrast color blocking, rough jagged edges, and a mix of solid blacks with vibrant primary tones to create a contemporary, abstract look.",

  "prompt": "A striking, highly stylized artistic illustration of {{subject}} rendered in a bold, mixed-media aesthetic reminiscent of textured gouache and acrylic markers. The artwork utilizes a distinct 'color blocking' technique where forms are defined by flat, jagged shapes rather than smooth gradients. The palette is dominated by distinct areas of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, creating a high-contrast visual impact set against a clean {{background_color}} background. The texture is crucial: visible dry-brush strokes, rough edges, and stippled noise patterns (particularly in textured areas like hair or fabric) give the image a tactile, hand-crafted feel. Black ink-like lines are thick, uneven, and expressive, occasionally breaking into wavy, zigzag, or scribbled patterns to define shadows and contours. The composition embraces negative space, allowing the {{background_color}} canvas to interact with the subject, sometimes cutting into the form to create highlights. Lighting is implied through sharp color changes rather than soft shadows, creating a posterized, graphic novel effect. The rendering style avoids photorealism entirely, favoring a flat, dimensional collage look with a grainy, matte finish. High contrast, sharp focus, artistic abstraction, screen print aesthetic, visible bristle marks, editorial illustration style, modern art, expressive strokes.",
  "background_prompt": "An abstract artistic background composition featuring rough, dry-brush textures and bold geometric fragments in {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}. The scene includes expressive scribbles, stippled noise patterns, and jagged blocks of color set against a clean {{background_color}} surface. The aesthetic mimics a torn paper collage or a painted surface with peeling layers, emphasizing tactile grunge, broad strokes, and artistic imperfection without any central subject, creating a decorative frame of raw artistic expression.",
