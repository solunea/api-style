  "description": "Un style d'illustration frappant mélangeant des aplats de couleurs audacieux avec la texture tactile de la gouache sèche ou des pastels. Caractérisé par des silhouettes expressives aux bords rugueux, des choix de couleurs 'fauves' non naturalistes et un trait noir gestuel imitant les marqueurs secs sur papier granuleux.",
  "description_en": "A striking illustrative style blending flat, bold color blocking with the tactile texture of dry gouache or chalk pastels. Characterized by expressive, rough-edged silhouettes, non-naturalistic 'fauvist' color choices, and confident, gestural black linework that mimics dry marker strokes on coarse paper.",

  "prompt": "Textured digital illustration style mimicking dry gouache, acrylic, and thick marker on coarse paper. The image features {{subject}} composed of bold, flat geometric color blocks with rough, scumbled edges. The rendering avoids smooth gradients in favor of hard-edged color separation and stippled texture transitions. Heavy, gestural black lines with a chalky, dry-media finish define shadows, beards, or deep contours, exhibiting variable thickness and raw, hand-drawn energy. The color palette is expressive and fauvist, utilizing {{primary_color}} for main forms and {{accent_color}} for striking highlights or contrasting zones, rejecting realistic tones for graphic impact. Texture plays a crucial role: visible grain, dry bristle drag marks, and splatter/stipple effects create a tactile surface. Lighting is abstract, implied solely through the placement of high-contrast color planes rather than volumetric shading. The composition is graphic and poster-like, utilizing negative space effectively to frame the subject. The atmosphere is {{mood}}, achieved through the interplay of vibrant hue saturation and gritty texture. Full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas, dry brush texture, scumbled edges, fauvist palette, flat design, expressive linework, coarse paper grain, stippling, splatter effect, high contrast, graphic novel style, abstract portraiture, acrylic texture, bold silhouette, artistic interpretation, raw finish, matte surface, vibrant tones, tactile illustration, hand-drawn aesthetic, rough contours.",
  "background_prompt": "A textured abstract background mimicking the surface of coarse art paper. Large, flat swathes of {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} are applied with a dry gouache technique, showing visible bristle marks and scumbled edges. The composition features loose, gestural shapes and stippled noise textures without any central subject. The surface quality is gritty and matte, with a tactile paper grain visible throughout. Minimalist and graphic, serving as a textured backdrop with abstract color blocking.",
