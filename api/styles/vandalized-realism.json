  "description": "Une juxtaposition provocatrice de peinture à l'huile académique haute fidélité et de graffitis de rue bruts et iconoclastes. Le style imite un portrait de musée formel qui a été dégradé par des traits de marqueur épais, plats et néon, créant un contraste saisissant entre la maîtrise traditionnelle et l'irrévérence moderne.",
  "description_en": "A provocative juxtaposition of high-fidelity academic oil painting and crude, iconoclastic street art graffiti. The style mimics a formal museum portrait that has been defaced with thick, flat, neon-bright marker strokes, creating a jarring contrast between traditional mastery and modern irreverence.",

  "prompt": "A provocative mixed-media masterpiece fusing traditional Academic Realism with iconoclastic street art vandalism, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas. The underlying medium is a high-fidelity oil portrait of {{subject}}, executed with museum-quality technique featuring smooth wet-on-wet blending, realistic subsurface scattering on skin textures, and visible fine brushwork in the clothing and hair. The subject is posed formally, exuding gravity and seriousness, rendered in a muted, sophisticated palette of charcoal greys, deep umbers, and desaturated flesh tones reminiscent of mid-20th-century official state portraiture. Superimposed directly onto this serious visage is a layer of thick, flat, hyper-saturated {{primary_color}} graffiti strokes. These lines are monoline, unwavering, and deliberately primitive, tracing a crude caricature—circles for glasses or eyes, a simple curve for the mouth, a jagged outline for the jaw—directly over the realistic features, mocking the subject's dignity. The rendering of the overlay is distinct: it lacks texture or shadow, appearing as a pure vector shape or opaque Posca marker ink sitting on top of the varnished oil surface. The lighting on the subject is a soft, directional Rembrandt setup with a gentle falloff into shadow, contrasting with the self-luminous, flat nature of the {{primary_color}} lines. The color science relies on the violent clash between the low-key, conservative values of the painting and the electric, high-chroma intensity of the {{accent_color}} and {{primary_color}} defacement. The composition is centered and static, allowing the chaotic energy of the vandalism to vibrate against the stillness of the pose. The atmosphere is one of satirical rebellion, absurdity, and modern angst. Reinforcement tags: vandalized art, defaced portrait, oil painting texture, mixed media, thick marker lines, crude drawing, juxtaposition, satire, academic realism, neon overlay, graffiti art, psychological tension, high contrast, muted background, vivid strokes, conceptual art, Banksy-esque, surrealism, paint over, visual irony.",

  "background_prompt": "A dark, moody, and textured backdrop typical of formal oil portraiture or studio photography. The surface appears to be a hand-painted canvas backdrop with subtle mottling, abstract cloud-like variations in tone, and a heavy vignette that darkens significantly towards the corners. The texture suggests a coarse linen weave or old varnish, absorbing light rather than reflecting it. The lighting is low-key and atmospheric, with a gradient that moves from a deep, rich shadow to a slightly lighter, desaturated mid-tone, providing a somber and serious environment without any distinct objects or forms. The color palette consists of deep greys, shadowy blacks, and faint hints of {{primary_color}} in the ambient atmosphere.",
