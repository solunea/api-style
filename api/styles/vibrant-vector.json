  "prompt": "A pristine digital flat vector illustration rendered in a sophisticated Corporate Memphis and mid-century modern graphic design style. The image features {{subject}} composed entirely of clean, razor-sharp geometric shapes and bezier curves, devoid of any traditional outlines or sketchiness. The rendering technique mimics a high-fidelity SVG export: strictly matte, zero texture, zero noise, and absolute edge precision. The subject's form is defined by contrasting planes of solid, saturated color rather than line work. Anatomy and clothing are stylized into elegant simplifications—hair flows in smooth, ribbon-like vector clumps, facial features are reduced to charming geometric primitives (perfect circles, gentle arcs), and clothing folds are depicted as sharp triangular shadow overlays. \n\nLighting is purely graphical, utilizing hard-edged cel-shading where shadows are represented by distinct, unblended blocks of a darker tone of the base hue, creating a crisp 2D depth. There are no gradients, airbrushing, or soft transitions; every color boundary is a hard cut. The color palette is vibrant and cheerful, anchored by {{primary_color}} and energized with pops of {{accent_color}}, adhering to a split-complementary or triadic harmony typical of modern tech branding. The composition is centered and iconographic, filling the frame completely with no borders or vignettes. The atmosphere is optimistic, smart, and approachable, evoking the clean visual language of premium startup illustrations or high-end lifestyle apps. {{mood}} and {{lighting}} influence the pose and color temperature, but the shading remains strictly flat and geometric. \n\nReinforcement tags: flat vector art, lineless illustration, corporate memphis style, geometric minimalism, hard-edged shading, solid color blocks, adobe illustrator style, vector graphics, vibrant saturation, clean silhouette, stylized proportions, tech illustration, modern graphic design, matte finish, no gradients, no texture, crisp details, playful aesthetics, character design, full bleed, no border, no frame, no canvas.",

The environment is constructed from clean, solid planes of color with no gradients or texture, adhering to a strict 2D graphic design aesthetic.

The lighting is global and flat, with hard-edged shadows cast by the geometric forms. The scene is purely decorative and atmospheric, devoid of any characters or focal subjects, designed to serve as a vibrant, clean backdrop.",
