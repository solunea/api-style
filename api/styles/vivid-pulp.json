  "description": "Un style graphique percutant qui juxtapose un rendu de personnage hyper-réaliste et dimensionnel contre des arrière-plans monochromatiques austères et plats. Il évoque l'énergie des couvertures de magazines pulp vintage, des affiches de films d'horreur et des écrans de chargement style GTA grâce à un éclairage clair-obscur dramatique, des textures de surface scintillantes et une isolation audacieuse de la silhouette.",
  "description_en": "A high-impact graphic style that juxtaposes hyper-realistic, dimensional character rendering against stark, flat, monochromatic backgrounds. It evokes the energy of vintage pulp magazine covers, horror movie posters, and GTA-style loading screens through dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, glistening surface textures, and bold silhouette isolation.",

  "prompt": "A high-octane, hyper-realistic digital acrylic painting of {{subject}} executed in a bold 'Vivid Pulp' aesthetic reminiscent of vintage movie posters and high-fidelity graphic novel covers. The visual language is defined by the striking contrast between the fully three-dimensional, deeply textured {{subject}} and a completely flat, solid {{primary_color}} background. The {{subject}} is rendered with extreme precision, mimicking the look of airbrushed gouache or advanced cel-shading found in Grand Theft Auto loading screens. Surfaces are treated with heightened realism: skin glistens with sweat or oil, metallic elements have sharp specular highlights, and fabrics show distinct weaves, all reacting dynamically to the lighting. \n\nThe lighting setup is theatrical and dramatic, utilizing a hard key light often positioned from a low or side angle to create deep, pitch-black shadows (chiaroscuro) that sculpt the form of the {{subject}}. A strong rim light or 'kicker' traces the contours of the {{subject}}, separating them sharply from the colored void behind. The color palette is intensely saturated; the {{subject}} retains realistic local colors but is heavily influenced by the ambient warmth or coolness of the scene, while the background remains a uniform, untextured field of {{primary_color}} that acts as pure negative space. The composition is aggressive and poster-like, with the {{subject}} dominating the frame. The image must be full bleed, occupying the entire canvas with no borders, no frames, and no margins, extending edge-to-edge. The aesthetic combines the grit of 1970s horror art with the polish of modern digital illustration, focusing on expression, impact, and volume.\n\nVivid Pulp style, vintage paperback cover art, Alex Ross lighting, Basil Gogos influence, GTA loading screen art, dramatic studio lighting, high contrast, saturated colors, glossy texture, sweat and grime details, hard edge painting, vector-like silhouette, commercial illustration, 8k resolution, cinematic composition, intense mood, full bleed, edge-to-edge, no border, no frame, no canvas, occupying entire space.",

  "background_prompt": "A completely minimal, abstract studio environment defined by a flood of intense {{primary_color}}. The scene is a vast, infinite cyclorama with absolutely no objects, props, or distinct horizon lines. The visual interest comes solely from the quality of the color field—a rich, saturated {{primary_color}} that appears flat and graphic, mimicking the negative space of a vintage silk-screen poster. There may be an extremely subtle, almost imperceptible gradient suggesting a floor plane or a distant light falloff, but the overall effect is of a solid, monolithic wall of color designed to make foreground elements pop. The texture is smooth, matte, and uniform, devoid of noise or grain, functioning purely as a high-impact graphic backdrop.",
