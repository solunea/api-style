    "prompt": "A highly textured digital gouache and wax crayon illustration of {{subject}} rendered in a charming, naive mid-century modern children's book style. The rendering mimics dry-brush acrylics applied to heavy-tooth watercolor paper, creating a scuffed, granular look where the white of the paper speckles through the pigment, particularly in shadow areas and large color blocks. The composition is strictly flat and orthographic, lacking deep perspective, presenting the scene like a collage of cut shapes. The {{subject}} is depicted with whimsical proportions, using bold, confident shapes filled with {{primary_color}} which has a chalky, matte finish. Fine details like hair, fur, or fabric weave are added with scratchy, imperfect colored pencil or graphite strokes in dark charcoal or {{accent_color}}. The lighting is completely flat and uniform, typical of screen printing or lithography, with no realistic volumetric shading; instead, depth is suggested through overlapping layers and slight shifts in texture density. The environment is rich and cluttered but organized, filling the frame edge-to-edge with stylized elements matching the {{mood}} atmosphere. Edges are organic and rough, characteristic of a manual dry brush or pastel stick, never vector-perfect. Colors are saturated but slightly muted, evoking a vintage 1960s palette.

The color science employs a nostalgic scheme dominated by {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}}, using dithering patterns (checkerboard pixel placement) only sparingly for texture transitions. Skin tones and organic surfaces are rendered with flat color blocking, while hair or fur utilizes jagged pixel groups to imply texture. The subject is rendered against a flat {{background_color}} backdrop, ensuring a clean, jagged pixel-perfect silhouette with absolutely no feathering or semi-transparent pixels at the edges, facilitating precise sprite extraction on {{background_color}}.

The image must occupy the entire canvas full bleed, edge-to-edge, with no borders or margins. The visual execution mimics a blend of digital vector shapes and analog dry media. The {{subject}} is constructed from solid, flat blocks of color with distinctively rough, dry-brush edges, resembling the texture of chalk, crayon, or oil pastel rubbed onto coarse paper. These color shapes are overlaid with thin, jittery, fine-point black ink lines that act as loose contours and internal details; the linework is intentionally imperfect, possessing a nervous, sketchy quality akin to a graphite pencil or a rapid pen sketch, sometimes detaching slightly from the color fill to emphasize the hand-drawn aesthetic. The lighting is completely flat with no volumetric shading, gradients, or cast shadows, relying entirely on the contrast between the color blocks to define form. The color palette utilizes {{primary_color}} and {{accent_color}} in a manner reminiscent of risograph or screen printing—vibrant, matte, and slightly desaturated. The surface texture is palpable, featuring a consistent paper grain or noise overlay that unifies the composition.
