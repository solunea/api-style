    "prompt": "A delightful, highly textured children's book illustration of {{subject}}, rendered in a whimsical mixed-media style combining colored pencils, wax crayons, and dry gouache. The artwork simulates a rough, tactile surface, perhaps heavy watercolor paper or cardstock, where the grain creates natural noise and white speckles within the color blocks.

The figure is set against a uniform, untextured background of {{primary_color}}, creating a stark and vibrating color relationship. The rendering is strictly two-dimensional, rejecting all forms of shading, gradients, depth of field, or internal texture. The {{subject}}'s form is abstracted and stylized with exaggerated proportions—amplified features, elongated limbs, and simplified, blob-like geometry that conveys movement and emotion through pure shape. The edges of the silhouette possess a specific 'scissor-cut' quality: smooth and continuous but with organic irregularities that suggest a handmade process rather than computer-generated perfection. The composition utilizes negative space aggressively, allowing the background color to carve into the subject's form to define posture and gesture.

The underlying base layer is rendered in the style of a high-end classical portrait or official headshot, featuring exquisite attention to detail: realistic skin pores, fine hair textures, sombre clothing, and dramatic chiaroscuro lighting that gives the subject weight and dignity. The color palette of the painting is muted and naturalistic, utilizing deep shadows and rich earth tones. \n\nSuperimposed directly onto this serious artwork is a flat, saturated, graffiti-style doodle in {{primary_color}}. This overlay acts as a 'defacement' or distinct graphical intervention, tracing the {{subject}}'s key features—such as the eyes, jawline, and accessories—in a simplified, iconographic manner, resembling a thick felt-tip marker or vector stroke.

Subtle hints of {{accent_color}} may appear within the realistic painting's attire or as a secondary, smaller doodle element to add depth. The composition is centered, creating a direct confrontation between the traditional fine art technique and the modern, rebellious street-art aesthetic.

    "prompt": "A masterful steel engraving illustration of {{subject}}, executed in the style of 19th-century scientific botanical and zoological plates. The rendering medium is a strict simulation of copperplate etching or intaglio printing, characterized by incredibly precise, sharp, vector-quality line work without any grey wash or gradients. Volume, form, and shading are constructed entirely through disciplined parallel hatching, contour hatching that wraps around the 3D geometry of the {{subject}}, and dense cross-hatching for the deepest shadows. The line weight varies intelligently—thicker, confident ink strokes define the outer silhouette and major structural elements, while microscopic, tapered hair-lines describe the surface texture (such as fur, feathers, or petals). \n\nThe color palette is strictly duotone: deep, saturated {{primary_color}} ink stamped onto a clean, matte {{accent_color}} paper background. There is no chromatic blending; colors are binary, relying on optical mixing through line density to create perceived tonal values. Lighting is conceptual and studio-like {{lighting}}, indicated solely by the absence of ink (paper white) for highlights and heavy line convergence for occlusion shadows. The aesthetic is academic, timeless, and reminiscent of high-security banknote art or vintage encyclopedia illustrations. The composition is centered and elegant, surrounded by ample negative space to emphasize the specimen-like isolation of the {{subject}}. {{mood}} atmosphere conveyed through the rigidity and perfection of the engraving technique.",

The image is constructed entirely from distinct, high-contrast lines of {{primary_color}} ink, utilizing expert cross-hatching, stippling, and curved contour hatching to generate volumetric form and texture. There are absolutely no smooth gradients, washes, or gray values; shading is achieved strictly through optical mixing via line density and spacing. The {{subject}} features microscopic attention to surface details—individual feathers, fur strands, or architectural elements are depicted with directional ink strokes that follow the organic curvature of the form. The lighting is conceptual and uniform, typical of academic study plates, revealing maximum structural detail. The artwork is isolated against a clean, flat {{background_color}} backdrop, specifically optimized for background removal. The edges of the {{subject}} are defined by the sharp, deliberate termination of ink lines rather than a continuous thick outline, creating a crisp, high-contrast silhouette against the {{background_color}} negative space. {{accent_color}} is applied sparingly to focal points or distinct markings, maintaining a predominantly duotone aesthetic. The line quality mimics the pressure sensitivity of a burin tool, with tapered starts and stops. The overall composition is static, dignified, and encyclopedic.",

    "prompt": "A charming, contemporary editorial illustration rendered in the specific medium of opaque gouache and dry-brush acrylic markers on heavy cold-press paper. The visual style is characterized by a naive, flattened perspective where {{subject}} is depicted with simplified geometry, playful proportions, and a lack of strict anatomical realism. The rendering technique focuses on bold color blocking; forms are defined not by black outlines but by the juxtaposition of high-contrast hues and rough, organic edges. The brushwork is distinctively 'dry', showing visible bristle streaks, scumbled textures, and areas where the paint thins to reveal the tooth of the paper beneath, creating a tactile, chalky matte finish. The lighting is non-realistic and uniform, eliminating cast shadows and specular highlights in favor of a 2D graphical clarity. The color palette is exuberant and saturated, utilizing {{primary_color}} as the dominant field and {{accent_color}} for popping details, with deep ultramarine or cobalt blue used exclusively for darker tonal values instead of black. The composition feels spontaneous and handcrafted, with slightly trembling lines and 'wobbly' straight edges that emphasize the human touch.

There are no black outlines; instead, forms are defined by the contrast between adjacent color fields and sketchy, loose colored pencil details overlaid on the paint. The texture is highly tactile, displaying visible dry-brush streaks, chalky matte finishes, and the granular tooth of the paper showing through thinner washes. Lighting is flat and graphic, lacking realistic gradients or cast shadows, relying instead on distinct value changes to suggest depth. The subject is composited against a clean, solid {{background_color}} backdrop to facilitate extraction, with the edges of the subject exhibiting a natural, painterly roughness—distinct and sharp enough for separation but retaining the organic irregularity of a dry brush stroke.
